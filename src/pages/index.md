Steve Fenton is an Octonaut at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) and five-time Microsoft MVP for developer technologies. He’s a [Software Punk]\(/blog/2020/07/the-software-punk-revolution/?swcfpc=1) and writer. You can find out [more about Steve Fenton here](/about-me/).

The primary audience for the writing found herein is me. It’s super-easy to forget stuff if you don’t write it down, as I did the second time I had to fix a really tricky certificate problem in .NET.

If only I had written down the answer, I could have saved hours of irritating replays of all the same steps I had used to find the problem in the first instance.

My goal in life is to start a punk revolution in software development. I am also secretly [S. M. Fenton](https://www.smfenton.uk/s-m-fenton/) the author of [The Vanishing Room](https://www.smfenton.uk/the-vanishing-room/).
