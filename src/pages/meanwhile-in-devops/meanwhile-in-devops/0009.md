Murray is presenting slides to the team. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant.

"So, we deploy more often and have shorter lead times," Murray says with excitement. "Basically, we deliver features much faster."

The audience respond with cautious silence. Arlo looks around and tentatively raises a hand.

"How do you know you're working on the right features?" Arlo asks.

Murray doesn't have an answer.
