Murray and Doug are passing in the hallway. Murray is looking confused and a little vacant.

"I've lost my earbuds again!" Murray laments.

Doug has a think and then hits a lightbulb moment. He starts sketching a pair of wireless earbuds. He then adds a line between the two buds and writes "Cord Safe Connector". He then adds another line from the Cord Safe Connector to a small plug, which he labels "Easy Find Anchor".

Yes. Doug invented classic headphones. Murray leaves in a state of confusion. Doug's earbud enhancements are a step backward? Right? RIGHT?!!!

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
