Murray is sharing a presentation on how his team has transformed its software delivery approach. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant.

"Testing is important," Murray begins. "So we did a shift-left on it".

Murray clicks and the next slide opens. It shows testing moving earlier in the process.

"Then we realized other things were also crucial," Murray continues. "So we did a shift-left on them, too."

Murray clicks again and a familiar slide appears.

"And that's how everything ended up back where it was in the first place!"

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
