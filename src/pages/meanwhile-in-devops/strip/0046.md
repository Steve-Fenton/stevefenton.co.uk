Ellis is presenting to a large crowd on his AI company's incredible forthcoming achievements. Although he's moving and speaking, there's a certain lifeless quality in his demeanor.

"We believe this tech will solve all crucial world problems within a year," Ellis declares to the wonder of the attending press.

A journalist interrups. "What area are you planning to start with?"

Ellis thinks for a second, and then says: "Horny chat bots."
