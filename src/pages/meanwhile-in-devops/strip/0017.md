Murray and Arlo are having a conversation about software delivery. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant.

"Continuous Delivery has an interwoven set of technical practices," Arlo says. "The practices power all the outcomes."

Murray blinks a couple of times, so Arlo continues.

"You can't really do Continuous Delivery without learning these crucial techniques."

"Aha!" Murray blurts. "So we should do Scrum, then we don't have to change!"

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
