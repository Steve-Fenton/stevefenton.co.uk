Blake is presenting the architecture for a new software project. The slide is projected on the wall beside him. The diagram shows a small data box with an arrow pointing to a giant flashing AI box.

"So we take the data, run it through our AI, and get the result," Blake explains.

"Wait," Arlo responds. "We're using AI for this?"

"Of course not," Blake answers. "But it stops users asking how it works and makes them assume the result is correct."
