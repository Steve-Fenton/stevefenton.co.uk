Doug is visiting the factory floor. He has a clipboard and is looking glum. He stops at Arlo on Work Station 1.

"Hello, Arlo," Doug says. "We need to make you more productive."

"What?" Arlo blurts. "Again?"

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
