Arlo is at the arcade playing on a whack-a-mole game. He's frantically smashing at the moles as he clocks up a score of 8,392 points. He whips back and forth, smashing at the moles until he hits 9,999 and the machine errors out.

The whack-a-mole table is smoldering from the onslaught, and the moles are exhausted.

Blake has been watching in awe.

"How did you get so good at whack-a-mole?" Blake asks.

Arlo, the mallet swinging by his hip, replies: "I'm a platform engineer."

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
