Arlo meets Murray in the corridor. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant.

"I hear you do YBYR here?" Arlo asks to break the awkward silence.

"What's that?" Murray asks with a big smile on his face.

"You build it, you run it," Arlo answers.

"Well," Murray thinks. "Not really. It's more like YBYF!"

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
