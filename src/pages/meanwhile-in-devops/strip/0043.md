Ellis has called a team meeting. Arlo, Murray, and Ellis are sitting in the boardroom drinking coffee. Arlo looks a little worried, and Murray looks like he's thinking of being on holiday.

"We need to boost productivity," Ellis begins. "What do you need?"

"Our machines are underpowered," Arlo offers. "And we only have 15-inch screens."

Later that day, Ellis reports into the productivity project manager, Doug.

"So," Doug says, drawing out the "o" sound. "What did they need?"

Ellis doesn't even pause for a heartbeat before saying "AI".

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
