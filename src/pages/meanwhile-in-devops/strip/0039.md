Murray is standing in the middle of the room looking happy and a little vacant. He's wearing a bright white suit with the cuffs rolled, a blue shirt, and white loafers.

"Add some frozen music," he shouts. "Make it more Testarossa!"

Arlo strolls into the room to find Murray shouting.

"What the heck are you doing?" Arlo asks.

"I'm Vice Coding," Murray replies.
