Murray and Arlo bump into each other in the office.

"I read a post that said we shouldn't deploy on Friday," Murray says with excitement. "It's bad for work/life balance."

"So we can only deploy Monday to Thursday?" Arlo asks.

"No," exclaims Murray. "We're gonna do all deployments on the weekend."

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
