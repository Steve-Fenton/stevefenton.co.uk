Arlo, Murray, and Ellis are in the breakout room having drinks. Ellis seems stressed, and Murray looks a little vacant. Arlo decides to break the awkward silence.

"Did you see that really well-balanced research report on coding assistants?" Arlo asks.

Murray and Ellis both answer at once.

"Yeah, it said they don't work at all!" Blurts Murray.

"Yeah, it said they're brilliant," Ellis announces.

They stop and look at each other in surprise.

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
