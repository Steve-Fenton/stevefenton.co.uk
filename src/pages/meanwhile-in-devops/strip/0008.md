Murray and Arlo are having a conversation about cost control. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant.

"Self-hosting our version control saves our team $100 per month" Murray says with excitement.

"So," says Arlo. "There's no cost at all to the self-hosted version?"

"None at all!" Murray pauses for just a second, before saying: "Just the server, backups, patching, tool updates, the knock on effect of that cabling issue, and that time we lost all the data!"

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
