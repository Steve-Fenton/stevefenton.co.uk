Blake is in his garage doing a hobby project. He's holding a sharp saw.

"Where to start with this cabinet?" Blake thinks to himself. After a moment, he decides he should make a jig to make it easier to perfect the rounded corners.

Monday evening, he starts assembling the jig.

Tuesday evening, he refines the design and makes adjustments.

 Wednesday evening, he fine-tunes the jig to get the final design.

He steps back from the completed jig and then makes a dramatic realization. He throws his hands in the air and shouts to the empty room: "I've used up all my materials!"

Today's cartoon was inspired by Paul Stovell's post on [Platform Engineering and woodworking](https://octopus.com/blog/platform-engineering-and-woodworking).

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
