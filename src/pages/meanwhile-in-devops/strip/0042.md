Doug has returned from his social influencer course with his new phone and a host of new engagement tricks. He begins finger-typing furiously.

"Congrats to Tay-Tay and Travis on their recent engagement. #Love," he types to start a thread.

"That's gonna need one heck of a pre-nup. #Legal," he adds.

"Which is why I updated our compliance page for developers. #ReadIt," he finishes, then closes Slack.

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
