It's 2023. Arlo is sitting next to Ellis in the office.

"Code complete!" Arlo exclaims after finishing a code change.

"No way," exclaims Ellis. "We can't trust you to make a change without code review, security scan, and design review."

It's 2026. Codebot is sitting next to Ellis in the office.

"Kode complee," Codebot emits in an electronic voice.

Ellis replies: "Cool!"
