A cartoon in three frames.

An e-reader is displayed, featuring a large screen and buttons for navigating pages and accessing a menu.

An updated e-reader features a clean design with no buttons and a touchscreen, which makes you accidentally change page whenever you try to clear dust from the screen.

The latest e-reader innovation. An add-on device with physical buttons to change the page. $10 and lost somewhere at the bottom of your rucksack.
