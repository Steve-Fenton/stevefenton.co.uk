Ellis is meeting with the team over a coffee in the board room. Ellis is looking stressed.
"We've decided," Ellis starts ominously. "To rewrite our front end to use the latest framework."

After 12 months and millions of dollars, the end users receive the launch email. It's a time of great celebration.

The end user opens the email and reads the message.

"Get ready for our new app and website," reads the subject.

"No! No! Nooooooo!" Cries the user, throwing their hands in the air.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
