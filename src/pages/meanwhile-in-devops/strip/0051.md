Ellis is set up at a big AI conference, ready to draw in the punters to his new company, Pik-Tec. He's standing in front of a large banner that reads, "AICon: Not just AI, but also a con."

"You should totally buy our AI image generator," Ellis calls out to an attendee.

"No thanks," the attendee responds. "I hate AI images."

"Oh," Ellis responds. "Then you should totally buy our AI image detector."

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
