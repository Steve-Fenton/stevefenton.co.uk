Arlo, Murray, and Ellis are having a coffee break. Murray is happily vacant, and Ellis is stressed. Arlo is listening to their conversation.

"I think practice beats theory," Ellis declares. "I've been doing project management for 10 years!"

"Nonsense," Murray counters. "Theory is where you find all the lessons learned in the past."

Arlo can't listen to the debate any longer without saying something. "What's stopping you from doing both?"

Murray and Ellis stop and stare, as if the thought never occurred to them.

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
