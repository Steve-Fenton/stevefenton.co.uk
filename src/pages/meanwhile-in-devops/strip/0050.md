A three-panel cartoon.

In the first panel, good software delivery is taken and put in a box with "Agile" written on the front in marker pen.

Then Agile is declared dead, so the box containing good software delivery has a label pasted on it to cover up the word "Agile" with "DevOps".

Then DevOps is declared dead, so the box containing good software delivery has a new label added to cover both "Agile" and "DevOps" with "Platform Engineering".

Inside the box, good software delivery makes a little sign begging people to open the box and use it.

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
