> I told my wife I was going out to buy an envelope. 'Oh,' she says. 'Well, you're not a poor man. You know, why don't you go online and buy a hundred envelopes and put them in the closet?
> 
> And so I pretend not to hear her. And go out to get an envelope because I'm going to have a hell of a good time in the process of buying one envelope. I meet a lot of people. And, see some great looking babes. And a fire engine goes by. And I give them the thumbs up. And, and ask a woman what kind of dog that is. 
>
> And, and I don't know. The moral of the story is, is we're here on Earth to fart around. And, of course, the computers will do us out of that. And, what the computer people don't realize, or they don't care, is we're dancing animals. You know, we love to move around. And, we're not supposed to dance at all any more.

#### Davinci tips

1. Fix each video first (zoom, position, etc)
2. Add intro/outro videos
3. Editing
4. Add appropriate fade-in/out (but otherwise hard cut throughout)
5. Insert pre-roll

Export settings

- Choose the rocket ship icon at the bottom
- QuickTime
- H.264
- 3840 x 2160 Ultra HD
- 29.97 frame rate
- Quality **Restrict to** `100000`

Audio export settings

- Choose the **Audio Only** preset
- Format: MP3
- Constant bit rate
- 320 Kb/s

I seem to get away with a minimal toolset! It will likely expand over time.

`CMD` + `B` cuts all tracks in the timeline at the selected point

`D` toggles the selected track on or off

It seems most natural to truncate dead air at the point you're cutting to different video track.

When sound bounces around (like everyone laughs at something) it feels natural to show that to the viewer so the sound has more context, like movement and facial expressions.

When you have a pre-roll clip idea, select the video and audio, copy, go back to the beginning and use **Paste Insert** from the **Edit** menu. Select all and add empty space before the pre-roll, then de-select the pre-roll and move everything else to add empty space after the pre-roll.

### Keyboard

I'm making an effort to get used to the default keyboard layout, assisted by a Logitech Ergo K860 (US international). Just living with the defaults will make it easier to switch between my office and travel setup and future machines.

The one thing I can't seem to retrain is how home and end work. I'm very used to this working per line, i.e., home goes to the start of a line, end goes to the end of the line. On Mac, it works per document and I keep zipping off to the start or end of a document and losing my place.

So, I'm using [Karbiner elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) and from [PC style shortcuts](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#pc_shortcuts) import **End key to the end of the line (Control + e)** and **Home key to the beginning of the line (Control + a)** rules.
