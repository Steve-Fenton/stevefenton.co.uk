As of July 2020, I have re-aligned my reading list to [The Software Punk Revolution](https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/2020/07/the-software-punk-revolution/). We need a fundamental shift and we need it now. These books contain the seeds that will grow in healthy ways inside your head.

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Book">## <cite itemprop="name">Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps</cite>

<span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Nicole Forsgren PhD</span></span>, <span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Jez Humble</span></span>, and <span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Gene Kim</span></span>  
<span itemprop="description">The amount of research and analysis that has gone into this book is stunning. This is basically a collection of practices that create high performing teams, where each practice has a substantial body of evidence to suggest it really does mean you’re more likely to suceed with your software development. You shouldn’t really be allowed to run a team if you haven’t read it.</span>

<span itemprop="description">This book sets up Tom and Timothy as software versions of Michel de Nostredame. What they wrote about in this book eventually became hot topics of debate some years later. They cover a broad range of issues that kill programmer productivity and it is still a must read if you have any influence over the conditions your code is created in.</span>
