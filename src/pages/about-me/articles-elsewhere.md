## Modern Lean/Agile

## Software delivery history

- [1950-1990: Early software delivery models](https://octopus.com/devops/history/early-software-delivery-models/) \
  It all started with phased models, like Lincoln Labs, waterfall, and the spiral model.
- [1990-2010: Lightweight software delivery methods](https://octopus.com/devops/history/lightweight-software-delivery-methods/) \
  The lightweight revolution brought us Lean and Agile, things like Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), and Kanban.
- [2010-present: The modern era of research-backed software delivery](https://octopus.com/devops/history/research-backed-software-delivery/) \
  We are currently using quantitative and qualitative research to find out what works and assessing it against real organizational outcomes.

## Octopus Deploy

- [Config as Code strategies](https://octopus.com/blog/config-as-code-strategies) \
  Helps you use the Octopus configuration as code feature most effectively.
- [Best practices for Octopus Spaces](https://octopus.com/blog/best-practices-spaces) \
  Discover the best way to divide your deployment projects to keep things organised.
- [Mapping manual deployments](https://octopus.com/blog/mapping-manual-deployments) \
  Use Octopus to document and track manual deployments and use this as a jumping-off point to automate steps.

### White papers

I have three white papers on DevOps and Continuous Delivery:

- [The importance of Continuous Delivery](https://octopus.com/whitepapers/lv-the-importance-of-continuous-delivery) \
  This paper outlines Continuous Delivery and draws on research to highlight the benefits.
- [How to map your deployment pipelines](https://octopus.com/whitepapers/lv-how-to-map-your-deployment-pipeline) \
  This paper provides a starting point for mapping deployment pipelines.
- [Measuring Continuous Delivery and DevOps](https://octopus.com/whitepapers/lv-measuring-continuous-delivery-and-devops) \
  This paper provides guidance on using metrics and frameworks for good ways to measure software delivery.
