I have been enjoying some coverage in various magazines and blogs and will be sharing some of the features here.

## The AI governance policy engineering managers needed yesterday

Jennifer Riggins wrote a really practical guide about the need for people to get their policy in order around generative AI. I was lucky enough to be included with my thoughts on the allure of volume. At Octopus, we have a company value about _doing fewer things at a higher quality_.

> “We’re taking a deliberate path of avoiding the allure of volume. Yes, we could get more things by pumping them out, but we’re more interested in creating fewer things at higher quality. That makes some of the options – [like] ChatGPT – less appealing,” Octopus Deploy’s Fenton said. “When software delivery is the constraint, a business has to make choices. Imagine if that constraint were removed, so you could have all the features you ever wanted – would that be good software?”

## React DOM – Best TypeScript Books and Tutorials

September 2017  

React DOM, the React newsletter, featured Pro TypeScript in their list of the best TypeScript books and tutorials. They said:

> Pro TypeScript starts at the very basics of TypeScript, introducing TypeScript and all its major features. It starts with object oriented programming and compilers going through everything in between. This book covers everything you need to consider while building and running a TypeScript application. Pro TypeScript even goes into design patterns, best practices and adding automated testing to your TypeScript app.
>
> Pro TypeScript is a great book for both beginners and advanced TypeScript developers. This is a book that is very through and is ideal for those that have no prior experience or knowledge of TypeScript. Pro TypeScript is a practical guide to TypeScript that will take you closer to becoming a TypeScript Professional.

## What Pixel – Top Ten TypeScript Books

2017  

The What Pixel top ten TypeScript books features Pro TypeScript in the top spot. They said:

> This is perhaps one of the best books for beginners and experts alike. If you’re brand new to TypeScript you will learn everything you need by reading Pro TypeScript. The author Steve Fenton does an excellent job of explaining the fundamentals and how TS compiles down into JavaScript.
> 
> But Steve also explains specific design patterns and best practices for writing quality TypeScript code. Each chapter builds upon the last and you never feel like you’re left out to dry on your own. – [What Pixel](http://whatpixel.com/top-10-typescript-books/)

## ZenHub on Medium

June 2016  

ZenHub used a little quote in their article “How to use GitHub for agile project management”.

> If a developer is interrupted with a question, it could put their work back by hours for each interruption. This is because of the amount of stuff they are holding in their immediate memory while they are working on a feature. They will have parsed lots of code in the area they will be working on and will have projected their changes in their mind before they start coding and the interruption will impact their focus on this information.  
> Once interrupted the developer may decide to batch other interruptions like email into the break — but this elongates the gap and makes it more likely that the information will be squirrelled away into harder to access places.

## JAXenter

March 2015  

Natali Vlatko talks about #NoEstimates and mentions some of my thoughts on the subject (along with those of some of the #NoEstimates thought leaders).

> Fenton advises that to eventually work without estimates requires a building of trust that may not already exist, therefore you shouldn’t be aiming for #NoEstimates without it. He feels the anger that has been thrust upon the topic has come out of a misunderstanding of the framework, with people interpreting the phrase ‘some teams have found that they don’t need to use estimates’ as ‘YOU must stop using estimates’.

## Rob D Moore

## Franky’s Notes

March 2014  

Franky kindly recommended my InfoQ book, TypeScript for C# Programmers.

## Ryan O’Neill

February 2014  

Ryan O’Neill reviewed my free TypeScript Succinctly ebook, available from Syncfusion.

> If you just want the summary, get the book, it’s free, well written, does not waffle on (unlike myself) and gets you started with TypeScript fast. This book was my introduction to TypeScript and has enabled me to build a lot of tested JavaScript. If you are unsure if you need TypeScript then read on.

## Microsoft

August 2013

> The e-book is specifically aimed at .NET developers, based on version 0.9 of Typescript.

## Corrado’s Blog

August 2013  

Corrado reviewed my free TypeScript Succinctly ebook, available from Syncfusion.

> The book doesn’t pretend to make you a TypeScript guru but its a great introduction if you want seriously mastering it, it starts from what happens under the hood: how code is transformed into pure ECMAScript compatible JavaScript and vice versa to how to start writing some code in Visual Studio after installing the required extension.

## Fokko’s View on ALM

17th June 2013  

Fokko Veegens kindly mentioned my articles on unit testing after speaking at SDN Conference.

> …During my talk at the SDN conference, I told about misconceptions regarding unit testing. Some people were looking at me with a frown when I told this. I would like to refer to the blog of Steve Fenton who wrote about this subject and I rate his post on this topic quite high.

## .NET Magazine

2nd October 2012  

I was quoted in an article in .NET Magazine on the new TypeScript language:

> …Steve Fenton calling it a “great new take on the JavaScript problem”, and “the first that doesn’t assume that JavaScript is a problem in the first place”. He said TypeScript “just adds some syntactic sugar that makes the development experience more productive”.
