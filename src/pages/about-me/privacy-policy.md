I’m not a business, I’m an individual human. However, I still want to let you know what happens when you visit my website.

I don’t collect data for marketing purposes, although you can [buy my books](https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/publications/) if you choose to look at them and buy them.

My website uses a Content Management System (CMS) that will store some cookies, but not anything containing personal data except in some cases a unique user identifier, which might be a number or random text. I use some CMS extensions that protect my website from malicious web traffic and they have a [privacy policy](https://www.wordfence.com/privacy-policy/) to cover how they use data.

The tools provided for free by Google allow me to find errors on my pages and get a general idea of how the population of awesome web people use my website. Google have a [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) that covers how they use your data. I personally never know who you are based on the aggregated data Google show me. I have configured Google to use anonymisation of IP addresses and turned off ad personalisation signals.

I receive contact forms by email and I keep them in my email archive if they say nice things. You can [contact me](https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/contact/) to request that I delete all emails that you have sent. I don’t share data or use it for marketing purposes, which is why I don’t ask for your permission to do either of these things.

## Browser Extensions

My browser extensions don’t collect or transmit data and only perform transient interactions on the active web page, which are lost on refresh.
