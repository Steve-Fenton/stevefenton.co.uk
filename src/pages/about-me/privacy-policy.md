description: Find out what data is collected when you visit my personal site.
---

I’m not a business, I’m just a normal human. Just an innnocent human\*. However, I still want to let you know what happens when you visit my website.

I don’t collect data for marketing purposes, although you can [buy my books](/publications/) if you choose to look at them and buy them.

I'm using Microsoft Clarity to collect insights about my site (but not my users). You can read [Microsoft'sprivacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/privacystatement) and you can opt out by selecting "Microsoft" on the [Digital Advertising Alliance website](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).

Due to the EU court cases, I'm migrating away from Google Analytics. Until this is complete, the tools provided for free by Google allow me to find errors on my pages and get a general idea of how the population of awesome web people use my website. Google have a [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) that covers how they use your data. I never know who you are based on the aggregated data that Google shows me. I have configured Google to anonymise IP addresses and turned off ad personalisation signals.

## Browser Extensions

My browser extensions don’t collect or transmit data and only perform transient interactions on the active web page, which are lost on refresh.
