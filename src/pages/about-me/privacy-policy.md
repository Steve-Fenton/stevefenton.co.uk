I’m not a business, I’m just a normal human. Just an innnocent human\*. However, I still want to let you know what happens when you visit my website.

I don’t collect data for marketing purposes, although you can [buy my books](/publications/) if you choose to look at them and buy them.

The tools provided for free by Google allow me to find errors on my pages and get a general idea of how the population of awesome web people use my website. Google have a [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) that covers how they use your data. I personally never know who you are based on the aggregated data Google show me. I have configured Google to use anonymisation of IP addresses and turned off ad personalisation signals.

## Browser Extensions

My browser extensions don’t collect or transmit data and only perform transient interactions on the active web page, which are lost on refresh.

\* An explantion on this is here:
