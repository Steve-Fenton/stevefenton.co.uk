Thanks for visiting. You'll find information about me any work here.

I'm fascinated by systems of work. When I was young, my grandmother gave me a broken clock to see if I could fix it. I spend a day looking inside the bakelite casing at all the cogs and interconnected parts. It was tempting to grab a tiny screwdriver and start disassembling the clock, but instead I used the thin point of the screwdriver to poke around to see which cogs had movement, and which were seized. This instinct to poke around at things to understand how they work has never left me.

This curiosity is applied through my day job at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com). My time is divided between research, participation in community groups, poking around at systems of work, and sharing what I find. I've written articles, given conference talks, and can often be found in online communities interested in topics related to better software delivery, better leadership, and better organizations that better serve humanity.

My book collection inspires me to keep learning new things and I read about 30 books each year, which is not quite as many as I buy each year.

Most folks are looking for my [blog](/blog/1/) or my [feed](/feed.xml), but you'll find more links to explore in my navigation menu and site footer.

Oh, and that clock? I never got it working.
