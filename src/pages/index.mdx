The primary audience for the writing found herein is me. It’s super-easy to forget stuff if you don’t write it down, as I did the second time I had to fix a tricky certificate problem in .NET on the (at the time) newly released Windows Server 2003.

If only I had written down the answer. I could have saved hours of irritating replays of the steps I had used to find the problem in the first instance.

My goal in life is to start a punk revolution in software development. I am also secretly [S. M. Fenton](https://www.smfenton.uk/s-m-fenton/) the author of [The Vanishing Room](https://www.smfenton.uk/the-vanishing-room/).
