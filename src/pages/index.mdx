Thanks for visiting. You'll find information about me and my work here.

I'm fascinated by systems of workâ€”how they function, where they break, and what makes them truly effective. This obsession began early. When I was young, my grandmother gave me a broken clock to see if I could fix it. For hours, I studied the intricate mechanism inside the Bakelite casing: the delicate balance wheels, the precise gear trains, the interconnected parts that once moved in perfect synchronization.

It would have been easy to grab a tiny screwdriver and start disassembling everything, but instead I used its thin point to carefully probe each component; testing which cogs still had movement and identifying which had seized completely. I was learning the clock's failure language. This methodical approach to understanding how complex systems work, and more importantly, how they fail, has shaped everything I do.

Today, I apply this same curiosity through my day job at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com). My time is divided between research, participation in community groups, examining systems of work, and sharing what I discover. I've written articles, given conference talks, and can often be found in online communities exploring topics related to better software delivery, better leadership, and better organizations that better serve humanity.

My growing book collection fuels my commitment to continuous learning. I read about 30 books each year, which is not quite as many as I buy.

Oh, and that clock? I never got it working.
