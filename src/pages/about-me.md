description: A short biography of Steve Fenton.
---

Steve Fenton is an **Octonaut** at [Octopus Deploy](https://www.octopus.com/) and seven-time Microsoft MVP for developer technologies. He’s a [Software Punk](/blog/2020/07/the-software-punk-revolution/), an author, a programming-architect, a pragmatist/abstractionist, and a generalising-generalist. He has written books on [TypeScript](/publications/pro-typescript/), [Octopus Deploy](/publications/exploring-octopus-deploy/), and [Web Operations Monitoring](/publications/web-ops-dashboards-monitoring-and-alerting/) (and also occasionally writes *genre fiction disguised as literary fiction* inspired by J Sheridan La Fanu, Mary Shelley, and H. P. Lovecraft, such as [The Vanishing Room](https://smfenton.uk/the-vanishing-room/)).

His current day job is *writing*. His previous day jobs have spanned the worlds of Product Management, Data and Analytics, Support, and Software Development, typically in leadership roles. These are brought together in the [DITE Cycle](/blog/2019/09/the-dite-cycle-data-insight-theory-experiment/).

Like many of you, he’s too busy to remember all of this stuff, so he writes it all down here. Some of his friends also do this, see the links at the end of this page.

Steve studied *Psychology* at OSC, and ***Anarchy in the UK**: A History of Punk from 1976-1978* at the University of Reading.
