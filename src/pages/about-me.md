Steve Fenton researches the socio-technical systems behind software delivery; how organizations, people, and technology actually work together (or don't). At Octopus Deploy, he explores GitOps, Platform Engineering, Continuous Delivery, and compliance through a lens shaped by punk history, psychology, and the kind of genre fiction that asks uncomfortable questions about systems and society.

He's an eight-time Microsoft MVP (DevOps), a DORA Community Guide, and a member of the CNCF Platform Engineering Community Group. He's written books on TypeScript, Octopus Deploy, and Web Operations Monitoring, and occasionally writes horror fiction that reveals truths about how things actually work.

A self-described Software Punk, pragmatist-abstractionist, and generalising-generalist, Steve studied _Psychology_ at OSC and the _history of punk (1976-1978)_ at the University of Reading. Those aren't side interests; they're how he thinks.
