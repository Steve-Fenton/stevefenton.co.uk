## Notes on Publications

If you are looking for fiction, my [Gothic tales can be found on my author website](https://smfenton.uk/).

I have written a few books, but the images above show my active book projects:

- [Pro TypeScript (Second Edition)](/publications/pro-typescript/)
- [Web Ops Dashboards (Monitoring, Alerting, etc)](/publications/web-ops-dashboards-monitoring-and-alerting/)
- [Exploring Octopus Deploy](/publications/exploring-octopus-deploy/)
- [The Humans are Dead](/publications/the-humans-are-dead/)
- [Cranked](/publications/cranked/).

Please note that Pro TypeScript (Second Edition) is my prime book on the TypeScript language. My older TypeScript books are quite dated now. I wrote TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers in October 2012 and TypeScript for C# Programmers in July 2013.

The first edition of Pro TypeScript, which took eight months to write, replaced all of these mini-book projects for me. The second edition of Pro TypeScript (January 2018) contains so many updates I canâ€™t rightly recommend any of the older books.

If you have any questions about my active titles, [please get in touch](/contact/).
