Continuing my thread of HTML5 form goodies, this article concentrates on some new input elements. In particular, we are going to look at email, web address, search and colour inputs.

### Email

The email input is useful for several reasons. Firstly, the browser can take care of validating that the input is a valid email address. If you have ever researched the correct regular expression for an email address, you will have discovered that the most common regular expression in use actually wonâ€™t allow many valid email addresses. On top of this, mobile browsers can show the right keyboard layout for entering email addresses.

```
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
```
### URL (sic, recte URI)

The Uniform Resource Locator, or Uniform Resource Indicator as it should correctly be named is most likely to be used to gather a web address. Similarly to the email input, browsers can validate the input and mobile devices can display an appropriate keyboard layout.

```
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
<input type="url" name="uri" placeholder="Enter your web address">
```
### Search

This input type is a little more obscure than the other options. We are not expecting any validation from browsers on this element, but by marking the element as a search field, browsers can style it and give it similar behaviour to the search box on the browser itself.

```
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
<input type="search" name="search">
```
### Color (sic, recte Colour)

The color input type is a complete transformation of the input field. Instead of a text box, the browser can present a colour-picker for the user to select a colour, rather than forcing them to know the hexadecimal value of minty-greenish-blue.

```
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
<input type="color" name="colour">
```
### Next Episode!
