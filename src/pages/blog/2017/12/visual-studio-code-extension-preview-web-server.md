This is just a nod to the handy little Visual Studio Code Extension: [Preview on Web Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yuichinukiyama.vscode-preview-server).

Now you *can* configure a task, or run a command, or set up a local web server yourselfâ€¦ but why not just install this extension and then just hit `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `L` to load the web page into a browser, using a local web server.

When you just want to quickly view a web page, with the scripts being loaded correctly relative to the root path; this Visual Studio Code extension is a great time saver.
