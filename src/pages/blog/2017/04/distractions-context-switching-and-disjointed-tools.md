ZenHub have quoted me in an article posted on developer productivity. You can read about distractions, context switching, and disjointed tools on the [ZenHub article Become a Productive, Distraction-Free Developer](https://www.zenhub.com/blog/become-a-productive-distraction-free-developer/).

If you are having major problems getting some focus time, you could try some of these ideas that I have used in various teams (different ideas work in different contexts…)

- Nominate one person each week to be “The Disturbed”. They handle all interruptions and shield everyone else’s focus. A big arrow pointing at the current nominee helps everyone go to the right place and avoids the classic distruption: “who is The Disturbed this week?”.
- Make sure you give people a regular time where their questions can be presented without being an interruption. The lack of this known “good time for questions” will mean they happen at random times.
- [Pomodoro Technique](/blog/2011/10/the-pomodoro-technique/). A disciplined system of work and rest designed to aid productivity. Watch out for [the mistakes I made when I first tried Pomodoro Techique](/blog/2012/10/pomodoro-mistakes-and-objectives/).
- Avoid blocking developers from accessing important development resources. [Implementing a web proxy that thinks Stack Overflow is a forum and MSDN in a blog – and therefore shouldn’t be looked at during work hours](/blog/2013/03/your-web-proxy-is-killing-productivity/) – if frankly ridiculous.
