I don’t know how this is possible, but you can be programming computers since all they were was a command prompt… and some young whipper-snapper can still surprise you with an awesome productivity trick.

So here’s the story. I picked up a trick years ago whereby if you held the shift-key down and right-clicked inside a folder, you could open a command window that was “ready to use” in that folder. This saved issuing a `cd` command with some arbitrary path to get you into the folder.

Recently, this menu item has been usurped with an “Open Powershell window here” option. This makes sense as I probably spend more time in Powershell than Command Prompt… except when I’m chugging some Node awesome!

### Productivity surprise

So I was taking a look at how I could add the Command Prompt version back in. Then the smart young developer next to me leant over and said:

> You know you can just type `cmd` into the folder address bar right?!

Well, truth be told – I completely did **not** know that you could do this. I had been using the shift-right-click trick all this time.

So if you have the folder open…

And you type `cmd` into the folder address bar…

Then you get a Command Prompt Window in your current folder!

Although many of you will probably be thinking “yeah… I know”, there must be others out there who have been using some other way of achieving this and it may help to increase their joy and productivity.
