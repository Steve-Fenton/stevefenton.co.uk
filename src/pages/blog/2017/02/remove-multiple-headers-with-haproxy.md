Do you ever wonder if your server is giving away too much information in the HTTP headers?

This problem is easily fixed with HAProxy by removing a header on your backendâ€¦

```
<pre class="prettyprint">rspidel Server
```

You can also remove multiple headers using the below syntax.

```
<pre class="prettyprint">rspidel (Server|X-AspNet-Version)
```
