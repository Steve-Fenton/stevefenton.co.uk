If you are pasting multiple screenshots of a web page into a single view, you should stop that and use the Firefox “Full Page Screenshot” feature.

You can enable it in the developer tools, which are available behind the F12 button:

![](/img/2017/01/screenshot-settings.png)

This adds a camera icon to the developer tools:

And when you press it, you get the whole page in one go in your downloads folder:
