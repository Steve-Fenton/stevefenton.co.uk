If you are pasting multiple screenshots of a web page into a single view, you should stop that and use the Firefox “Full Page Screenshot” feature.

You can enable it in the developer tools, which are available behind the F12 button:

:img{src="/img/2017/01/screenshot-settings.png" alt="Screenshot settings"}

This adds a camera icon to the developer tools:

:img{src="/img/2017/01/screenshot-icon.png" alt="Screenshot icon" loading="lazy"}

And when you press it, you get the whole page in one go in your downloads folder:

:img{src="/img/2017/01/screenshot-fullpage.png" alt="Full page screenshot" loading="lazy"}
