IF you can keep your curly braces when all about you  
Are losing theirs and blaming bugs on you,  
If you can write symmetrical code branches,  
And eliminate the duplication that they reveal;  
If you can remain positive in your conditions,  
And know when to switch to a switch,  
And when to eliminate branching with objects,  
Then you’ll be a clean coder my friend!
