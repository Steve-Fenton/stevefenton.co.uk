Color Oracle is a cool tool for Windows, Mac and Linux that simulates colour-blindness. It means you can actually test your designs for various visual impairments to make sure that your colour scheme doesn’t leave certain information invisible to anyone. You simply run Color Oracle and select one of the simulations to see an instant preview of how your design will look based on the particular impairment.

Colour-blindness is much more common than you’d think. There are six times more people with colour-blindness in the UK than their are people using Internet Explorer 6 – so if you are still testing your web design on Internet Explorer 6, but not testing it for colour-blindness, you are being stupid.You can [download Color Oracle for free from the Color Oracle website](http://colororacle.org/).
