Here are some rather tasty TypeScript resources that you should have in your tool-belt when you are raging the TypeScript code.

- [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/)  
    Great for trying out stuff and for helping to answer simple questions.
- [TypeScript GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)  
    If you find something weird, start a discussion or raise a bug.
- [Definitely Typed](http://definitelytyped.org/)  
    Boris Yankov’s repository of typings for tons of popular JavaScript libraries.
- [Official Announcement and Video](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2012/10/01/typescript-javascript-development-at-application-scale.aspx)  
    If you didn’t watch it – this is a great video to kick off your TypeScript journey.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript)  
    If you have a question about TypeScript, get it answered by the TypeScript team, other users or even me!
