This week I tidied my desk to remove all the distracting stuff and bizarre paperwork that seems to accumulate even though I'm a developer and can't think of any reason why any paperwork should be required in my job â€“ except maybe for copious numbers of sticky-notes.

All that is left are a couple of monitors, some headphones a keyboard and a mouse. Not only does it feel great to have a clear desk, it is also going to be easier to pair-program now that there is nothing in the way of other developers when they pair up with me.

Take a look and revel in the tidiness!
