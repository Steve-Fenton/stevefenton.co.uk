Murray and Arlo are discussing DevOps. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant. He points at his screen.

"DevOps was originally just about collaboration and shared goals," Arlo begins. "Then we did a decade of research on technical and cultural practices. Now we have our deepest ever understanding of software delivery!"

Murray leaps out of his chair.

"Yeah, but nobody *really* understands what DevOps is!"

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
