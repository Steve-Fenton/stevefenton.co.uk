Murray and Arlo are sitting at their desks, which are next to each other.. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant. He points at his screen.

"Check out the feature I just finished," Murray says with excitement.

"There are no tests. I thought we were doing TDD?" Arlo asks.

"We are," exclaims Murray. "I'm writing those next."

## Meanwhile in DevOps

If things go badly enough, this might be the only entry.
