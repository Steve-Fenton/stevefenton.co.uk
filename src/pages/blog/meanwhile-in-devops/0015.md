Ellis is presenting to the team he's working with. Ellis is looking a little stressed.

"When we kicked off Project Shed," Ellis says, indicating the plan to build a small wooden shed. "You all agreed it could be done in a day."

Ellis flicks to the next slide, which shows an updated plan that looks like a garage.

"We focused on user feedback and responded to change over following a plan."

Ellis moves to the next slide, which shows the garage integrated into a house.

"But you're five days over the original estimate and you need to work harder!"

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
