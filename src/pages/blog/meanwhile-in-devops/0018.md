Arlo is in the garden and spots Murray laying in a dog house. Murray is looking unhappy and a little vacant.

"Hey Murray," Arlo says. "What are you doing in the dog house? Did you forget to buy your girlfriend a Valentine's gift?"

"No," Murray replies. "I forgot to buy my girlfriend's *dog* a Valentine's gift."
