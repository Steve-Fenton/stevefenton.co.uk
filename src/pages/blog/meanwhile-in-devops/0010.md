Murray and Arlo are standing by Murray's desk. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant. He points at his screen.

"Over the past quarter," Murray says with excitement. "We've massively improved our metric dashboard."

Arlo raises his eyebrows.

"Has that helped you improve your software delivery?" Arlo asks.

"No!" Murray says, regaining his confidence after a moment of worry. "We can't do that until the metrics are perfect!"

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
