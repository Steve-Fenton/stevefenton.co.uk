The team is in a meeting room. Ellis is presenting while Arlo and Murray listen in. Arlo is looking uncertain.

Ellis finishes his long speech: "... and that's why average lead time for changes will be reported to the CTO," he says.

Later that day, Arlo and Murray are at the water cooler. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant.

"Hey Murray," Arlo says. "I'm worried about sharing these DORA metrics so broadly."

"Relax!" Murray says. "Just work on the features and I'll push 100 white space changes a day to keep the average low."

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
