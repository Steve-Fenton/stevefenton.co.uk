Murray and Arlo are sitting at their desks, which are next to each other.. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant. He points at his screen.

"We use long-lived project branches so we don't have to worry about merges," Murray says with excitement.

"But you still have to merge at the end of the project," Arlo observes.

"The end of the project," Murray laughs. "That's a good one!"
