Murray is presenting his big plan for the next year. He's looking happy and a little vacant. He points at his slides.

"This is how we've organized ourselves for years," Murray says with excitement, showing the org chart. "But we think we've come up with a way to really boost productivity."

Arlo, sitting near the back of the room, raises his eyebrows.

"I'm stoked to announce," Murray says with confidence. "The efficiency division!"
