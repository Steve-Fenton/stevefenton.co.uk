Ellis is updating the team on the DevOps metrics project. Ellis is looking a little stressed.

"It will be one week per dev tool to integrate into our custom <abbr title="business intelligence">BI</abbr> dashboard," he begins. "Plus four weeks to create a report across all that data."

The slides flick past. A series of developer tools with arrows pointing to a database. Then a dashboard mock up pulling data and showing a chart. The final slide pops up. It's a Gantt chart.

"So with scheduling," Ellis concludes. "We can work out our deployment frequency in about 5 months."

In the audience, Blake whispers to Arlo. "How often do *you* deploy?"

"Daily," Arlo responds, thus saving everyone 5 months.

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
