Murray and Arlo are sitting at their desks, which are next to each other.. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant. He points at his screen.

"The new feature I've been working on for a month... here comes the commit," Murray says with excitement.

Boop beep boop. The computer works on the commit.

"Oh no," exclaims Murray. "Merge hell! I don't get it..."

Arlo braces for what he knows Murray is about to say. He raised his eyebrows and then it comes.

"You merge all the time," Murray complains. "And this never happens to you!"

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
