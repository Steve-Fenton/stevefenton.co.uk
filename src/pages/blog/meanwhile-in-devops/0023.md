It's 2020. Blake has coded a pixel-perfect web page and the team is giving their usual constructive feedback.

"Can we adjust that lilac?" Ellis asks for the tenth time.

"The padding isn't right!" Exclaims Murray.

Fast forward to 2025. A robot called "ROB-BOT" is working on a prompt for a web page. It's using Blake's version as training data.

Using lots of water and electricity, ROB-BOT provides a janky page that uses a fixed background image with hot-spot regions instead of semantic markup. All the colours are wrong and the layout is a mess.

"Whoop!" Shouts Ellis.

"Love it!" Exclaims Murray.

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
