Ellis walks into the dev team's office. Arlo and Blake are sat together working, with some sticky notes on the desk next to them. Ellis is looking stressed.

"What the heck are you two doing?" Ellis asks in horror.

Arlo and Blake look up from their work.

"We're pair programming," Arlo responds.

"We can't afford to pay two developers and only get 1 feature," Ellis rants. "You're lucky all the managers and stakeholders missed this while they're in that three-hour change control board meeting!"

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
