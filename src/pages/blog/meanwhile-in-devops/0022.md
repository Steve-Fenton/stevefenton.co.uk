Doug is visiting the factory floor. He has a clipboard and is looking glum. He passes a machine that Blake is checking.

"Hi Doug," Blake says. "We need to pause the machine for maintenance."

"There's no time!" Doug replies.

A week later, Doug is doing the rounds with his clipboard.

"Hey Doug," Blake calls. "We need to replace that belt."

"There's no budget!" Doug responds.

Another week passes and Doug is surprised to find Blake dealing with an emergency.

"Doug," Blake says in exasperation. "The machine's on fire!"

"Operator error!" Doug declares.

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
