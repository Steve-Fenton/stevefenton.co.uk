Murray and Arlo are sitting at their desks, which are next to each other. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant.

"We're adopting Platform Engineering," Murray says with excitement. "I'm creating the <abbr title="internal developer platform">IDP</abbr>."

"So," says Arlo. "You'll build an <abbr title="internal developer platform">IDP</abbr> with optional adoption, based on regular chats with developers, to improve developer experience?"

Murray pauses for just a second, before saying: "Not <em>that</em> kind of Platform Engineering!"
