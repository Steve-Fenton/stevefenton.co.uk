Ellis is stood by the office Kanban board. The board is a solid wall of sticky notes with almost no gaps anywhere to be found.

"We're all really busy," Ellis complains. "Yet nothing is getting done!"

Blake looks at the board and sees the WIP limits for the columns have values like 200 and 40.

"Where did you get those WIP limits from?" Blake asks.

"Simple," Ellis replies. "5 developers and 1 tester, multiplied by 40 hours a week!"

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
