Murray and Arlo are standing by Murray's desk. Murray is looking happy and a little vacant. He points at his screen.

"This is our blue/green environment," Murray says with excitement.

Arlo raises his eyebrows.

"You mean 'environments', plural?" Arlo asks.

"Should it be 2 environments?" Murray says, looking worried. "Let's move on!"

Murray quickly switches to another application and says: "This is our CI/CD tool!"

## Meanwhile in DevOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.

If things go badly enough, this might be the only entry.
