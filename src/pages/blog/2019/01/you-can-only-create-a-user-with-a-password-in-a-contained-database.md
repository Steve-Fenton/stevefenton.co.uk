If you attempt to create a user in SQL Server and get the following error:

> You can only create a user with a password in a contained database

You probably didnâ€™t quite configure your database as you intended. You can use the script below to fix it up (substitute `DatabaseNameHere` with your actual database name.

```sql
EXEC sp_configure 'contained database authentication', 1
GO

RECONFIGURE
GO

ALTER DATABASE DatabaseNameHere
SET containment = PARTIAL
GO
```
