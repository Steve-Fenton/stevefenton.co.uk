This month (June 2020), Depaul UK launched the #SleepBedless campaign. They asked members of the public to [sleep without beds for a night](https://uk.depaulcharity.org/sleepbedless-campaign-launched) to raise awareness of hidden homelessness and to help fundraise to help them with their coronavirus crisis costs.

More than half of young people in hidden homelessness have suffered harm and Depaul offer services to support these people – including their [Nightstop](https://www.nightstop.org.uk/) initiative that offers emergency accommodation to young people.

This campaign will directly help vulnerable people, so spending one night without a bed and making a donation is a small gesture that might make a big difference. Having spent the night on the floor, I nominate my Geronimo Web friends [Dan Horrocks-Burgess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-horrocks-burgess/), [Petr Vinklarek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petr-vinkl%C3%A1rek-b2088bb7/), and [Rob Lawson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-j-lawson/) to do the same.

Why not join us?

The #SleepBedless campaign asks you to do three simple actions:

- SLEEP bedless for one night,
- [DONATE £5 to Depaul UK](https://donate.uk.depaulcharity.org/), and
- NOMINATE three other people to complete the #SleepBedless Challenge.

Why three people? Because £15 is enough to provide a bed for one night for a vulnerable young person. It makes sense doesn't it.
