**Revised, July 2014.** I have no idea what became of this product – I think it got rolled into a premium version of the Expression suite, but can’t find any references to it. Original article below…

Microsoft have just released a really cool new tool for comparing websites in different versions of the Internet Explorer browser. The full version, which is part of the Expression Web product can also compare other rendering engines – but the ability to test Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8 in one neat tool is really rather useful.

You have the option to perform a side-by-side compare, which highlights the differences between the rendering of any element you select – and there is also an ultra-impressive overlay comparison, which lets you see one page on top of the other.

Here’s the overlay comparison for my website. You can see the blurs where the margins get a slightly different treatment between the two browser versions, but other than that all is well.
