Revised, July 2014 – Please [see my update on dropping the HTML5 shim](/blog/2014/01/Goodbye-Old-Browsers/).

Having managed to get the HTML5 website working in all the popular browsers, I ran a test on a larger number of browsers and operating systems with the following result: If you are running the latest version of any major browser – it almost certainly works.It even works on my mobile phone, which is running an old version of Windows mobile.

If you are using a different browser to those listed below, [please get in touch](/contact/) to tell me how things look. I will be experimenting with the fixes to see if more browser coverage can be achieved.

More detail on the results can be found below.

## Works Fine

In these cases, the website does display, but with limited graphical support and with a generally in-line style.
