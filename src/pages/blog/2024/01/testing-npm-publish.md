I had an odd error where my `npm publish` command stopped including some files I expected to be included. To work out what was going on, I needed to run a process that would tell me what files would be included when I publish, so I can try out different file matching patterns.

The command that helped me do this is a dry run of the pack command:

```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```

This command includes a list of the files that will be included in the package.

```bash
npm notice 
npm notice ðŸ“¦  astro-accelerator@4.0.10
npm notice === Tarball Contents === 
npm notice 11.6kB  LICENSE
npm notice 1.0kB   README.md
npm notice 750B    astro.config.mjs
npm notice 40B     env.d.ts
npm notice 2.7kB   package.json
npm notice 21.9kB  public/css/main.css

npm notice 5.6kB   public/js/modules/detail-tabs.js
npm notice 545B    public/js/modules/events.js
...
```

This gave me fast feedback loops for testing different file matching patterns and I fixed everything without having to fire off many package updates.
