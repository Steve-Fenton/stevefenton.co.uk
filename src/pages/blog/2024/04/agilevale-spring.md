A wonderful thing happened in Agilevale. They discovered a spring. Something about the nearby mountains meant that the water from the spring was something special.

Drinking water is a good thing and the people who lived in and around Agilevale really enjoyed drinking the spring water. It was good water.

## The Agilevale community store

Before long, to meet the interest in the spring water, the town opened a small store called *Agilevale Spring* selling bottles of Agilevale water. You'd buy a crate of six glass bottles of water, and you'd bring the bottles back on your next trip to get a deposit back. That meant the bottles could be cleaned and re-used.

The popularity of the spring water was so great that the shop expanded. As well as selling the water, a selection of Agilevale merchandise was sold in the store and some local produce.

The town's name became synonymous with high-quality spring water.

## The Agilevale factory

Spotting the opportunity to associate themselves with the town, a business opened a factory in the outskirts of Agilevale. The factory would produce large volumes of bottled water under the name *Agilevale Bottled Water*. The scale of production meant they needed more water than the spring could produce, so the company drew river water and filtered it.

Although local companies weren't interested in changing supplier from *Agilevale Spring* to *Agilevale Bottled Water*, larger companies who were further from Agilevale liked the idea of purchasing large volumes of water from the town at a discounted rate. Not having tasted the spring water, they didn't know the difference between the water supplied by the smaller company and the factory; they just knew that Agilevale was known for great water.

"Agilevale water is the best in the world," the executives would say. "Get me some of that for the board room!"

There's no doubt that *Agilevale Bottled Water* had made a smart move associating themselves with the town and it's reputation for high quality spring water. Business was good.

## The Alliance of Water Graders

Although they loved the branding and values of *Agilevale Spring*, the price of *Agilevale Bottled Water* meant most locals tried it out. It was half the price of the spring water and all water is H2O at the end of the day, right?

Nobody tried it a second time, though. It tasted awful compared to the proper stuff.

Sometimes, the locals would hear from an out-of-town friend who asked why there was so much fuss about the water in Agilevale. The friend had tried the water and didn't like it. In some cases, after heavy rainfall had allowed water companies to discharge combined sewer overflows, it had made them sick.

The locals would try to explain that *Agilevale Bottled Water* wasn't the same thing as *Agilevale Spring*. The problem was, *Agilevale Bottled Water* could be found *everywhere*, whereas the proper stuff was only available from a comparatively small local company.

Outside of Agilevale, the difference just wasn't clear. The factory certainly didn't intend for the difference to be understood, with their billboard banners showing panoramic views of the mountains that provided the source of the spring water.

*Agilevale Bottled Water* also ran a successful side business called *The Alliance of Water Graders*, which tested water for other companies and issued a grading accompanied by a certificate. The gradings were based on a sedimentation test, rather than on any inherent property of the water. While the certificate evidenced the coagulation and flocculation process had been completed, it didn't extend to measure the quality of filtration and disinfection and the process didn't extend to anyone tasting the water, as they couldn't get insurance to cover the risk.

Despite the weakness of the grading system, big corporations preferred to buy water with a certificate from *The Alliance of Water Graders*, so *Agilevale Bottled Water* was an easy choice. It was from Agilevale and it came with a certificate.

## Agilevale's reputation

Eventually, most people's experience of Agilevale came from trying *Agilevale Bottled Water*. As a result, they didn't like Agilevale and they avoided anything with the name. The value of the town's name became a net-negative, even though it had been the gold standard just a few years earlier.

The majority of water drinkers disliked Agilevale as a source because they'd never drank the spring water.

So, what happened to the spring? Did it dry up?

"Of course not," I reply, sipping from my glass of cool spring water. "It's as wonderful as ever."
