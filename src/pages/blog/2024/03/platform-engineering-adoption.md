There's no doubt that [Platform Engineering](https://octopus.com/devops/platform-engineering/) has been thrust into the collective conciousness. Since Team Topologies was published towards the end of 2019, the idea of a platform team has quickly become the spotlight concept in the book.

We need to be cautious about what happens next, though. Let's consider a couple of *reasons to be cautious*.

## Part one: Team Topologies

Platform teams are just one concept in Team Topologies. There are other teams and interaction modes that are just as useful. Using the right design will be a crucial success factor. Solving a complicated subsystem problem with a platform team isn't going to bring success.

You're going to be more successful if you understand all the team and interaction types in Team Topologies. You'll be able to tell when a platform team *isn't* the right way to solve your problem and what to do instead. Without understanding Team Topologies, everything problem is going to look like something to solve with a platform.

## Part two: Rapid adoption

We've all seen the adoption process for other things, like Agile. The early adopters have thought deeply about the problem and are committed to solving it in a particular way. The kinds of team early to the Agile software movement would have found paths to success no matter what - they were high-trust and highly collaborative, and would have adapted their process to work one way or another.

The next wave of adopters are attracted to the scent of success. They can see what's happening in that first wave and they are thirsty for it. That thirst leads to intense learning and experimentation. Books are inhaled and questions are asked - discussions happen between other folks in the organisation who are also tracking the trend.

Eventually, you reach the stage of adoption where things are market-driven. There's just an expectation that you *ought* to be doing something. It's not about that thirst for improvement, it becomes a line-item on an internal audit. This stage is where failures start emerging and everyone questions whether Agile can work at all.

Market-driven adoption will never be successful like those earlier thirst-motivated cases.

Platform Engineering has been accelerating rapidly since 2022 and we are already arriving in the Cranberries stage of adoption (Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?). This is bad news for the movement as we haven't got a huge history of success with which to dispute the thin-adoption failure stories that will be arriving soon.

Of course, it's not Platform Engineering's fault that there will be awful attempts that tick all the [anti-patterns of Platform Engineering](https://octopus.com/devops/platform-engineering/patterns-anti-patterns/). The rapid rise in interest makes it harder to separate the good from the bad.

Like Lean, Agile, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps - the core concepts are superbly useful and valuable. The pursuit of that value without an investment in learning how to use the knowledge will fail. It's useful to the movement to have a body of knowledge about what good looks like and we're still building that for Platform Engineering.

## Avoiding the mistakes

I created a set of decisions you can use to decide whether Platform Engineering is the answer to your problems. It helps you get some foundations in place that will make you more successful, but it also directs you away from Platform Engineering if it's not going to help you.

I've had some great feedback from the [DORA community](https://dora.community/), which I've incorporated. I'm still open to feedback if you have experiences to share that would shape this.
