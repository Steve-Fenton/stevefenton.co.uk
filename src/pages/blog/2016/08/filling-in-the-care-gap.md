![Circles](/img/2016/08/circles.jpg)

We all care quite a lot for the people we are close to.

We also care about the grand collection of *humanity*.

But we only *really* care about humanity if we can fill in the gap between these two circles. When you rage somebody off of the road, or are rude to a stranger, or engage people in busywork… these are all things you’d hate to happen to people you care about… so you don’t really care about these people, or about humanity.

It is time for those of us who care about people to include *all* people in that definition.
