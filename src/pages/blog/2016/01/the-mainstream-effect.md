The *mainstream effect* describes a level of popularity that a given technique may gain, which causes the general knowledge of it to become dangerously superficial.

When it exists in a small niche, amongst a dedicated community of practitioners, the technique proves to be highly effective. The technique is passed on from person to person in great detail and a deep understanding of the principles behind the technique are well known. As the technique gains traction, it is passed on faster and faster – and in much less detail. The result is that in many cases, only the *name* of the technique survives in common implementations. The mainstream version of the technique as practiced en masse is unrecognisable to the original community of practitioners.

Notable examples:

- Philosophy

Please [get in touch if you have other notable examples](https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/contact/) and I’ll include the best ones.

Thanks to Mark Jones for the TDD suggestion.
