If you are getting hammered by a robot, youâ€™ll probably want to find out the IP Address of the robot to see if it is a friendly one, or just someone playing with Kali Linux in a far off land.

The following Log Parser Studio query will get you a list of your top offenders:

```
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
SELECT
    c-ip,
    count(c-ip) as requestcount
FROM
    '[LOGFILEPATH]'
WHERE
    date = '2016-03-29' 
GROUP BY
    c-ip
ORDER BY
    count(c-ip) DESC
```
Just change the date as you need.

### Web Log Importer

If you are using [Web Log Importer](/tag/web-log-importer/), you can get the same information using the following query:

```
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
SELECT
    [c_ip],
    COUNT(1)
FROM
    LogEntry
WHERE
    [date] = '2016-03-29' 
GROUP BY
    [c_ip]
ORDER BY
    COUNT(1) DESC
```
