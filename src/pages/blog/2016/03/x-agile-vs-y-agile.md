[Agile software development](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is a natural sub-set of Theory-Y thinking[\*](#theory), from “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”, to principles such as:

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

… and:

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

If you want to be agile, you need to be Theory-Y.

<span id="theory">\*</span> Theory-Y is often considered a “management theory”, but actually is more general than that. Theory-Y is a fundamental assumption about human behaviour – that says people are intrisicly motivated (rather than Theory-X, which says they are motivated by rewards and punishments).
