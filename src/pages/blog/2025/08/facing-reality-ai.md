There's no doubt about it, we need to talk about AI. Many dimensions need to be discussed, and the wiring between these dimensions is getting crossed. The problem is, AI is a trigger subject, and you end up trapped between the sabot-wielding righteous and the foaming-at-the-mouth robot overlord devotees.

## The need for terms of engagement

So, we need some terms of engagement that let us talk about the middle. I don't want to dismiss the ethical and moral concerns. Many of them are valid, and someone must determine how to resolve the various conflicts. The hype machine I'm less tolerant of, but if you want to be super-excited about AI and imagine some quite extravagant claims about what it can do, go ahead and be your own joy.

The problem is, you can't talk about the practical everyday work when each conversation gets redirected to extremesville.

I've [promised never to use AI for my writing, art, or music](https://stevefenton.co.uk/blog/2023/02/facing-reality-ai/). My personal choice is that I'd rather give the world bad writing, art, and music that comes from my soul. You know I've kept my promise if you've seen my cartoons.

## Not for art, but for yawn-work

But if I'm writing a Python function to display a chart and need to remove splines and change the font, I'd rather use coding assistance than RTFM.

You see, I remember when text editors started highlighting syntax. It was brilliant. Then I remember when they added auto-complete, made auto-complete context-aware, and suggested the most likely auto-complete instead of an alphabetical list. I've used these funny shortcuts in IDEs where you type "testc" and hit tab, and it scaffolds out a whole test class, so I didn't have to.

I was allowed to talk about these in a way that's impossible in the current polarised and jumpy situation.

## I share your feelings

I want to share all your concerns. I agree! These billionaires are disconnected from reality and seemingly immune to any government intervention to reconnect them. I'm concerned about the power demands, the water use, and the unfair use of content.

Despite this, we need to build a safe space to talk about the practical application of these tools. So, I'm creating a page (this page) that I can point to with my terms of engagement for this discussion.

You can use it, too. And it's in a Git repo that you can use if you want to collaborate with me in good faith.

## Pragmatic limits on the discussion of applying AI tools to our work

Here are the terms under which I'm discussing AI. If I'm not responding to your tangential debates, it's likely due to this.

1. We want to talk to other people about how they use this technology, and how we use it, without being hauled off topic by the concerns we list and acknowledge below.
2. We acknowledge the ethical and moral problems attached to this technology, which are yet to be resolved.
3. We agree that the environmental impact of this technology must be considered at a time when we are already experiencing climate change.
4. We understand some people are very excited about this technology, possibly even beyond its capabilities.
5. We will be responsible when we talk about "productivity," as this is not a useful measure of the outcomes of this technology.
