I read books all the time. I frequently have to tidy my home office to stop it looking like a scene from the library in Ghostbusters with vertical <abbr title="To Be Read">TBR</abbr> stacks sprouting between the furniture. When [generative AI](/blog/2023/02/facing-reality-ai/) came on the scene, I kinda knew this day was coming, but here it is.

I'm currently levelling up my statistics and data chops so I can understand and contribute to research projects I'm involved in. I want to understand better so I can interpret research and undertake [my own applied research](/publications/software-delivery-research/). I've read great books by Halford, Spiegelhalter, Hall, Frost/Sturt et al, Hubbard, and more. Books on data analysis, statistics, research, and so on.

But today, I found one of the books I ordered was a word salad that surely can only have come from a generative AI model.

:::div{.note}

I'm working on the strong suspicion that the book I received was written by generative AI. That means I have to be a responsible adult about this. I can't share the book or author as there's a chance it's just a terrible poorly-written book by someone who doesn't have knowledge of the subject.

:::

The thing with generative AI is that it's pretty good at stringing words together. The sentences and paragraphs follow enough unwritten rules to appear like other writing. Without a strong guiding hand and liberal use of the <kbd>DEL</kbd> key, they tend to produce a large number of words that don't communicate any information. It's entirely possible for a human to write like this, but only if they don't know their subject and have no opinions.

Having read through a couple of chapters and convincing myself something was very off, I went back to see what signals I missed that might help me avoid wasting time and money on a similar book in the future.

## 1. Author squatting

The author has the same name as a real-life author of fiction. That means the author has an aggregate rating on book sites. The real-life author of fiction is pretty well rated, which is a signal that can convince you to buy. The real author has a well received memoir, with all the other books having no ratings.

When you look at the list of books, it seems more than likely that most of the titles are not written by the author of the memoir.

## 2. Lots of books in no time

In total, there are around 30 books added in the space of 2 months (April and May, 2024). This can happen if an author takes existing works and uploads them to a self-publishing portal. They may have been written at a rate of one a year and self-published, and now the author is taking advantage of modern independent distribution.

Lots of books in a short space of time is definitely a signal, though.

## 3. Lack of subject alignment

Lots of authors write about many different things, but there's usually something that links it all together. A software developer might write about languages, frameworks, and complimentary techniques. They might repair their own motorcycle in their spare time or have an idea for a vast fictional world of dragons. Despite the variety, you can usually see some relationship between the subjects.

The author of this book has written on financial independence, design tools, discovering inner peace, stress management, gardening, soap, social media, French cuisine, and data analysis. Many of the titles share the same shape.

## 4. Telltale titles

There are also some telltale titles in their list that I'm kicking myself I didn't check. There are books on maximizing revenue on a famous online store and a book about *leveraging AI for business*. It almost feels like they are telling on themselves if you put together their get-rich-quick with AI and online stores titles.

## 5. Cover art

Most of their books have cover art that looks kinda AI-generated. This is a tricky signal as lots of writers make the mistake of using generative AI to create blog post images and book covers. It's also muddied by self-publishing platforms having cover generators that produce similar looking stuff to this.

If you write short or long form content, it's probably advisable to avoid AI art generators as people will increasingly depend on this signal. AI art makes it at least likely you'll find AI content, too.

## 6. Taxonomy errors

The books are almost all listed under very general categories, like e-business and e-commerce. You'd expect a deep dive into a technical subject to be in a more specific category, like data mining (which is a common category used by similar books published by technical publishers).

The selected categories are linked to those get-rich-quick titles in the list, so they were just uploaded to the same categories.

## It's a combination of signals

Any one of these signals could be forgiven, I guess. I feel a little stupid that I didn't spot these signs before making a purchase - I've paid the idiot-tax here for not paying attention when I was making a buying decision. Because I've never been bitten before, I wasn't as cautious.

However, I'm now highly aware and will be checking before I buy for these signals.

This is one of the sad side-effects of this stuff. I'm now far less likely to take a chance on an indie book in the future. That means genuine indie-authors will lose out if I have a false-positive when I'm checking the signals. Generative AI can be quite harmful here. Because generative AI is perceived as low-value due to the lack of originality, it devalues original works by dragging them into the same swamp.

## Honesty

If you want to sell simulated gemstones, you're required to include the brand name of the material (like cubic zirconia), state clearly the gem is simulated in the the details and description, and prefix every use of the gemstone with the word *simulated*, for example "simulated diamond". Everyone can understand why this needs to be clear when selling fake gemstones, yet people are passing off AI-generated books as if they are written by real people.

When you want to learn a subject, you don't want a dictionary or glossary of terms. The value comes from the experience and opinions of the author.

You can easily learn TypeScript without even buying a book, but I tried to communicate some strong opinions around specific area based on my real-world experience so people learning from my book could avoid some messy stuff I learned to avoid. The valuable knowledge wasn't about where to put a `:` or a `=>`, though that stuff is needed. The value was in how to embrace structural types and inference to reduce the number of annotations you add to your code.

## Resolution

I was angry enough about this book that I've danced the returns dance. I have a return label and the book is going back with a clear explanation that I don't expect to get AI-generated content when I pay for a book.

I'll also be more careful in checking for signals from now on.
