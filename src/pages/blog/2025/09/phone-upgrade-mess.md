There's a current trend about the positive effects of being bored. Two elements of boredom enhance your ability to think and create.

Firstly, you get space. We're so busy these days that there's no space anywhere. We're an overlapping infinity of saishimi-like tasks, and you just can't think when you hit 100% capacity. You can only do.

Secondly, when you're bored, you pay attention to all the stuff you're usually distracted from. Phones are pinging. Slack messages are a leaking sewer pipe of constant interruptions. Someone on the net disagrees with something.

So boredom gives the gifts of space and attention. When you have both, incredible things happen. It's why people have so many revelations while waiting for something in a coffee shop, pizzeria, or laundrette. (If you don't believe me, there's the [Agile quick fix diet](https://stevefenton.co.uk/blog/2015/07/state-of-agile-2015/), [hand-offs and coffee](https://stevefenton.co.uk/blog/2013/08/thinking-about-hand-offs-and-coffee/), or [Agilevale spring water](https://stevefenton.co.uk/blog/2024/04/agilevale-spring/).)

Today's boredom was a gift from my mobile provider, and it made me think about how we measure teams and individuals. It made me think about the harm it does to customers and, in the end, our business.

## A simple phone upgrade

"Your phone is due for an upgrade," the message said. So, the usual process of selecting a handset and triggering the upgrade cascade through the family started; we upgrade at the top and pass the handsets down the chain to keep them in use for as long as possible. Those who take the best care of their handsets get the newest ones.

Order complete.

Except the next day there's a text. "There's a problem with your order." Well, this will be easy enough to resolve, though there's the usual dance of proving who I am via chat before I discover the problem. The problem is pretty simple. They don't have the handset they offered me online. I'm willing to forgive a slip-up. We continue.

My Digital Sales Messaging Guide tells me: "you do not need to worry, let me help you out." I'm reassured. There's a quick note to inform me about some rough edges on the chat app they decided to buy. Many things can cause it to bug out, so they let me know all the things I can't do, like minimize the browser window, as it will disconnect us.

Then we need to confirm I'm the "accont [sic] holder", which I admit is a lucky near-miss from a worse spelling error that could have occurred.

## Make me an offer

My Digital Sales Messaging Guide heads off to find me a deal for a similar handset they have in stock. I've already forgiven them for listing handsets they don't have in stock. They want to help me. Very soon, they return and make me an offer.

"I have a deal for you where you can get the deal with new device at just 43.67GBP per month with unlimited data :)"

This is a little more expensive than my order, so I push back a little to say we didn't select the unlimited plan, and asked if switching the plan would bring the price closer to our original order.

"I can understand your point. However, that was with the old device that is currently unavailable with the stocks, this is the reason your order could not placed from our end. However, we do have a deal with the new device that one you picked was refurbished here you can get the new device with unlimited data at just 43.67GBP with the new device."

Okay. The handset is a newer model. I get it. While I'm typing a reluctant acceptance, another message comes in to tell me about their broadband, but I quickly dismiss this. Switching broadband is not a task for the near future.

## The bait is taken, do the switch

That's when my Digital Sales Messaging Guide grabs the rug with both hands and pulls. You see, the price they gave me in the first place is only available if I also buy the broadband. You know, they just forgot to mention that until I said yes. Telesales 101: Get them to say yes before you make your move.

"Trust me this will be the great deal for you even better you can get the most reliable speed and the zero fluctuation Wi-Fi.?"

And here's our first problem. You've just pulled a bait and switch on me and you then ask me to trust you. That's a problem. In fact, it's a giant sky-darkening-godzilla-silhouette problem.

"Okay," I reply. "I don't think I'm interested as this doesn't seem like a 'problem with my order' conversation. It feels like a churn conversation."

## The resilience of sales

We have a back and forth about how I'm unhappy, and my Digital Sales Messaging Guide has to ask if I want to raise a complaint, which is a good idea as I'll need to flag some issues to someone after the chat. The ultimate termination of this conversation is my request to cancel the order.

But, of course, it's not that simple. There's a script for this. My Digital Sales Messaging Guide effortlessly switches from hardcore promotion of how amazing their broadband is and how it's an amazing discount (though what amazes me is that the total price is now somewhere in the double-what-I-ordered zone, so it doesn't feel much like a discount).

I get told I have a multi-line discount that could be applied. Then the price gets split into multiple components that all sound cheaper, but add up to more than I wanted to pay. Then they ask me what I want to spend, but by this point, I don't want to spend any money with this company.

The loop goes round a few times. I ask them to cancel the order. They say: "Sure, but before I do, here's another offer".

Then they offer me the original price, without having to take up the broadband. This forces me to explain to them that I'm a stubborn mule when it comes to this stuff.

"I can go ahead with the same getting an exception from our end," the Digital Sales Messaging Guide says. "Trust me this will be the good deal."

"No," I type firmly. "The thing is, these company/customer relationships are built on trust. I 
know you're running the standard script, but the rug-pull of providing a price and then revealing it's only available if I buy another product damages that trust. When this happens, all those years of reliable service on multiple 
devices gets de-railed. I value that trust above all else, including price."

Twenty minutes between requesting cancellation and getting cancellation. Twenty minutes of dodging and diving, while repeating "trust me" with a frequency that suggests they are perhaps aware that what they're doing isn't trustworthy.

## It's the metrics and measures

And it's not even the fault of my Digital Sales Messaging Guide. There's a metric here. It might be an individual goal to sell broadband. It might be an upsell league table. Or it might be a goal further up the chain, which results in scripts and playbooks being handed to the front-liners.

I worked in retail, on the e-commerce website for a high-street chain. I begged them not to do the at-till upsell. They aimed to get all customers to spend an extra fiver as they rang up the purchase of a game. When they did it to me, it made me want to stop buying from the store. It also held up the queue, which made some people give up even before they got hit with the upsell. Get five quid today, lose the customer forever. Not a great deal.

But we keep seeing this behavior of turning measurements into goals and suffering the entirely predictable results.

On LinkedIn this week, my friend Kev shared that one CTO has started a league table of "# of tokens of code input into AI tools". I hope neither you nor I depend on that software. We all know better than [AI-gavage](https://thenewstack.io/stop-force-feeding-ai-to-your-developers/), right?

## Just think it through

My call to action for all leaders, execs, and managers is this. When you're thinking of setting goals around metrics, go somewhere where you can get bored for twenty to forty minutes. Let your mind walk through the very predictable ways people will respond to the goals you're about to set. What new behaviors will emerge, and which existing activities that you really need to succeed will end up dropped to achieve your goals?
