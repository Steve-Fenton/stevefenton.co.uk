Harry, lord of heck, is briefing the demons in the daily stand up. He looks maliciously cunning.

"My subjects," Harry announces loudly. "We will give them opium for free and then make them pay when they are addicted."

Time passes. 200 years of time, in fact. Harry is once again gathering the demons for the daily stand up.

"My subjects," Harry cries to the assembled horde. "We will let them use AI for free and then make them pay once they've fired their employees!"

## Meanwhile in HeckOps

The *Meanwhile in DevOps* series, and it's dark spin off *Meanwhile in HeckOps*, is an ill-conceived and badly drawn comic strip about software delivery *and evil*.

I'm many things, but not an artist. It's doubtful whether I'm funny, too.
