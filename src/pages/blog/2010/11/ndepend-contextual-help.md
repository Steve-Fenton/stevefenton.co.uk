I’ve talked a couple of times about NDepend recently, in the article [NDepend For Beginners](/2010/10/NDepend-For-Beginners/).

NDpend is jammed full of code analysis tools, but sometimes you need a bit of a hint to tell you what is going on in the various matrix displays and graphs – well now NDepend is getting some improvements to help explain what is going on, with some contextual help.

The enlarged tool-tips appear outside of the graphic to avoid cluttering the diagrams, and give a bit of information on what is going on and what to do next.

You can [read more about the new features on Patrick Smacchia’s blog](http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/2010/10/11/software-learnability-increased-with-context-sensitive-help/).
