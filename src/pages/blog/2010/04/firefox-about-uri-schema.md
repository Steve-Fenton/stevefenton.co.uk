The “about:” URI schema has been around since the days of Netscape, but there is more to it than the common “about:blank” reference for an empty page. Some of these options give you an advanced view over Firefox and its cache – and others a just a bit of entertainment.

Here is a list of some common examples, all of these work in Firefox (tested in Firefox 3.6.3).

To use any of these, simply type them into the address bar.
