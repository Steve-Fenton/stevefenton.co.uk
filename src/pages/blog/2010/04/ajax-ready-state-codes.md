If you are hand-cranking an AJAX request, youâ€™ll be looking for a Ready State of 4 and a Status of 200. But what other Ready State Codes are there and what do they mean?

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function () {
    alert("readyState: " + request.readyState);
};
```

```
0. Uninitialized
1. Set up, but not sent
2. Sent
3. In flight
4. Complete
```

It is only when the readyState is Complete that you normally bother to check the Status code, which is a standard HTTP header (200 for OK).
