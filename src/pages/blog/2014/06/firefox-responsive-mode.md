This is yet another article in praise of a Firefox developer tools feature. Last week I was [getting excited about the 3D mode](/blog/2014/06/firefox-3d-mode/), but today I’m equally uncontrollable over the responsive mode.

Once again, if you don’t have the little icon on the right hand side of the developer tools header, you can hit the settings (the little cog on the left) and tick the “Responsive Design Mode” box.

Your site will be loaded in a window of a size you control using a drop-down list and you can even use the camera icon above your web page to grab a screen shot… like so:

:::div{.inset}
:img{src="/img/2015/07/firefox-responsive-screenshot.jpg" alt="Firefox Responsive Mode" loading="lazy"}

So once again, it is time to have a fresh look at the Firefox developer tools if you haven’t seen them in a while – they have come on a long way since the first “Inspect Element” basic options were added (remember when you checked that out and decided to stick with Firebug?)
