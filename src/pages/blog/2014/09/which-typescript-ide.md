The question of which TypeScript IDE to use comes up reasonably often, so here is a quick run down of my three favourites as of now! You may well prefer another IDE and I’d love to hear about it.

### Visual Studio

- Windows
- Mac

There should be little surprise that [Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/) has really superb support for TypeScript. If you are already using Visual Studio it is unlikely that you’ll be looking to edit your TypeScript anywhere else.

### Visual Studio Code

- Windows
- Linux
- Mac

[Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight cross-platform editor from Microsoft. It is early days, but the TypeScript support is exceptional.

### Atom

- Windows
- Linux
- Mac

The [atom-typescript extension](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) brings all the features of TypeScript to the awesome Atom editor.

### WebStorm / PHPStorm

- Windows
- Linux
- Mac

[JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) have a reasonably priced commercial IDE that support TypeScript. Be prepared for a whole bunch of awesome features.
