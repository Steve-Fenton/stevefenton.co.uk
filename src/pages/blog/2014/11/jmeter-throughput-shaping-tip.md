Here is a quick tip about JMeterâ€™s throughput shaping capability, when using the jp@gc Throughput Shaping Timer.

If you want to test, for example, 8 messages per second, the Throughput Shaping Timer will adjust the rate to make sure that:

1. You send no more than 8 messages per second on average
2. You send no less than 7 messages per second on average

So if the aim of your testing is to ensure you can handle 8 messages per second as a minimum, you need to enter **9 messages per second** in your throughput shaping timer.
