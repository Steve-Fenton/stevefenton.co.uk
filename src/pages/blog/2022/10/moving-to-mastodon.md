Mastodon is offering us a different way to approach social networking. Rather than a big central corporation tugging on the reigns, many independent communities have various topics and moderation policies. You join a server in your wheelhouse and connect to people across any server.

## Why use Mastodon

Mastodon respects your timeline, which is probably the first thing that will make you consider it. It's not owned by billionaires, and it's not funded by advertising revenue. It's similar enough to timeline-based social like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others - except you only see the content you decided to add to your feed.

The key benefits of Mastodon are:

- [Open source](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon): The code is on GitHub with an AGPL-3.0 license.
- Decentralised: There are lots of servers, but you can follow people from different spaces.
- Not for sale: Your feed is content from people you follow, in chronological order, with no ads

> Your home feed should be filled with what matters to you most, not what a corporation thinks you should see. Radically different social media, back in the hands of the people. <cite>[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)</cite>

## Join Mastodon

To get started with Mastodon, you need to find a server related to a topic you are interested in (like "technology"). You might want to defer this decision and sign up to [mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social/) while you explore. You can migrate to another server later.

## Key differences

Post action icons look familiar, but it's worth understanding how they work.

:::

1. Reply (or reply to thread): Hit this to add a post to the thread.
2. Boost: Adds the post to your timeline and shares it with your followers.
3. Favourite: Makes a beep happen for the user who wrote the post. It's endorphin-only and doesn't share the post, though you can go back and find your favourites later.
4. Bookmark: Places the post in a "bookmarks" folder for you to review later.
5. Share: Let's you share the post to other networks or copy a link to it.
6. More... there are more options, one notable one being "Delete and redraft" - probably a better solution than editable posts.

Asides from the functional differences, which are subtle, there's a much more significant difference on Mastodon. We're all here looking to get away from the clearly broken corporate social networks, where people get attention for hot takes and burns. Let's use this opportunity to build a healthier conversation.

It's best to add too many people and filter it to curate your feed later.

## Conclusion

Here's to a better future for social, where we can control our feed and hopefully begin a healthy conversation.
