This is a short post to explain the difference between The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project. Funnily enough, there are more similarities than differences (though it’s a key difference).

## The Phoenix Project

Written by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford, The Phoenix Project is a business novel following Bill, IT Manager for Parts Unlimited. The project is critical to the survival of the company, but it’s a mess.

Bill, assisted by a mysterious mentor (a nod to Goldratt’s *Jonah*), must learn new techniques if he wants to save the project and the company.

## The Unicorn Project

Written by Gene Kim, The Unicorn Project takes us back to Parts Unlimited on *the same timeline* as the original Phoenix Project. This time, we see things play out from the perspective of the team trying to deliver the software.

Maxine finds herself thrown in with a bunch of misfit rebels who are given the impossible task of fixing the Phoenix project.

## Summary

So, the key *difference* between the two books is the perspective. The Phoenix Project follows the managers as they learn what is needed to recover a disastrous project, while The Unicorn Project follows the same timeline from the perspective of the direct contributors to development, testing, and operations.

In The Phoenix Project, we look at the management changes that are needed. This is based on techniques such as Theory of Constraints.

In The Unicorn Project we see how the software delivery process has to change. This is based on DevOps practices.
