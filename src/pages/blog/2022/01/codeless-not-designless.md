This thought is the product of many years of experience with different code-free solutions to problems usually solved with programming. I thought it might end up being an anti-codeless rant when the thought first occurred to me, but it is actually an argument in favour of *design* rather than against *code-free* systems. Hence the change of title to “codeless does not equal designless”. And yes, I know that *designless* isn’t a word.

The sharp edge of my argument is that any _designless_ system will hobble your organisation, so you have to make sure you have no designless system, whether it has code or not.

When you opt for a codeless system, you are responsible for ensuring that the people who create it can do so with adequate design quality.

## Bookkeeping

You can look at paper-based systems to get a feel for this. In my first job, I helped the accounts department with their great-big leather ledger (GBLL). Double-entry bookkeeping meant that mistakes leapt from the pages. This was a well-designed system.

This shows how design is present in any system, whether there is code or not.

When I joined a company that received hundreds of paper application forms a day, I was fascinated to discover how they designed the forms. They had to manage the competing constraints of making forms easy to fill out by a customer **and** quick for an administrator to accurately enter into a green-screen terminal.

## Patterns, concepts, and questions

Software developers are armed with a toolbox filled with patterns, concepts, and questions that elicit a well-formed expression of what the system should do. They can also implement the software in ways that mirror the *GBLL*, whereby the software can determine whether it produces the expected result.

Code enables the software to last beyond a developer's tenure, as it is a form of documentation.

## Designless monsters

Conversely, anyone who has worked with designless business systems will have seen them fail either when their creator moves on or gets eaten by their own monster.

I’m not just talking about those mega-spreadsheets some businesses create or the famous Access database on a shared network drive – the same problems crop up in CRM systems, SEO tools, or even Google Analytics when implemented without appropriate design.

## Summary

- Software developers produce a *design*
- The design can be expressed to humans and computers using code or something else… but code works really well

This is why I’m having trouble generating excitement for “codeless” systems. In so many cases, it can end up being “designless”.

However, any implementation of software within an organisation (with or without code) can succeed if you ensure it is in the hands of someone who has a strong grip on design.
