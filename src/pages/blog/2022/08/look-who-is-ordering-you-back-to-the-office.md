This week, Malcolm Gladwell joined the ranks of people yelling at workers to *get back to work*. Like many people arguing for a return to office work, they tell us they don't believe it's possible to do a good job unless you are under management observation.

> It’s not in your best interest to work at home. I know it’s a hassle to come into the office, but if you’re just sitting in your pyjamas in your bedroom, is that the work-life you want to live? <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

There are several reasons to get frustrated by this.

## Pyjamas

I work at a company with a <a href="https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/trust">high-trust environment</a> - the kind of place Ron Westrum referred to as a *generative culture*. Our handbook says, <a href="https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/where-you-work">"do your best work from where you work best"</a>. I don't go to work in pyjamas. I wear a rather snazzy set of pinstripe trousers and a company tee. I would wear the same if I went to the office in Brisbane. It would be fine for me to work in pyjamas if that's what helped me do my best work and live my best life... but I find dressing for work helps me get my head into the game.

When someone accuses people who work from home of *wearing pyjamas*, it makes it look like their only work-from-home experience is from Internet memes. Or, perhaps, this is what *they* would do if they worked from home. Even worse, they might think they are an exception; they wouldn't dream of wearing pyjamas, but they believe "workers" would.

## Sense of belonging

> ...we want you to have a feeling of belonging and to feel necessary... and if you’re not here it’s really hard to do that. <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

The reality here is that modern managers should be able to build a distributed team with a sense of purpose. It *is* challenging work to do that, which is why managers get paid to do it. If you are a manager in a modern workplace, distributed team chops are a necessary skill. If you don't have the knowledge or the techniques, go see what the old-timers of distributed teams are doing (by old-timers, we're talking about companies that did this before the pandemic).

After so many managers scrambled into positions without any thought for the additional skills they need beyond being good at the work, there are already loads of teams sitting together in the same room with no sense of purpose or belonging. This problem is not unique to distributed teams. There are specific challenges to making the magic happen in a distributed team, but it has been done.

## Your best interest

Do you know who can discover your best interests? You. Not Alan Sugar, who privately owns [Amsprop Estates Limited](https://www.amsprop.com/), a portfolio of "ultra-prime Central London and core City of London freehold properties", and not Malcolm Gladwell. 

Malcolm doesn't even know most of you.

While writing his excellent book, Blink, Malcolm found what best served his interests and the interests of the project. This is how he described his process in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2005/mar/05/workandcareers.politicsphilosophyandsociety">2005</a>.

> I hate desks. Desks are now banished. I work better when I'm comfortable. <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

Yes, you read that right. Malcolm worked from home and various other spots because *it's where he did his best work*. He used places like his sofa, the Savoy, and the Monmouth Coffee Company. Anywhere except an office with a desk, because desks are now banished. Of course, he still had an office at The New Yorker:

> I used to go there every day and I slowly kind of weaned myself away... I felt like I was in exile when I was in the New Yorker offices. I missed being connected. <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

Yes, he missed being *connected*.

## Summary

I could just let Malcolm provide the closing argument for what we already know to be true. Access to an office isn't terrible, but the key is working where you can do your best stuff. What might be a total grind in an office or at a desk might become a breeze, given the correct location. Finding different spaces that inspire you to do awesome stuff is the key to working remotely.

> It seems like a fun activity now. Kind of casual. It's been more seamlessly integrated into my life and that's made it much more pleasurable. I never want to be at a desk again. <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

Some people have pointed out that Malcolm relies a little on PR, which I suppose is true. Saying stuff to raise attention so people buy your excellent books is one thing. Depending on the amount of collateral damage, I suppose.

When people with a financial interest in office space ordered us back to the office (Alan), it was clear why they wanted us back there. The same goes for all the people whose business is adjacent to office space. You could follow the money trail in most cases.

Eventually, those businesses will adjust to a decentralised reality. Those empty local shop fronts may have a renaissance as people look for those locations to place in their creative rotation. A coffee shop within a twenty-minute walk that served great coffee could do fair business, though perhaps not as much as one giant coffee shop with the associated poor service levels. We may not want to travel to a big office miles away, but smaller local shared spaces might be appealing when you need something like that in your toolbox.

I'm not entirely sure about Malcolm Gladwell's motivation for his recent statements. Maybe they were just off-the-cuff comments that we've taken a bit too seriously... it doesn't really seem like he believes any of the stuff about belonging coming from shared offices!

Don't rush back to your office just yet, as there might be a bit more to this story.
