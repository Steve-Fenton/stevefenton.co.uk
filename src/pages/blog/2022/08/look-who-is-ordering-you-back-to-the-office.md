## A Note From Steve

The primary audience for the writing found herein is me. It’s super-easy to forget stuff if you don’t write it down, as I did the *second time* I had to fix a really tricky certificate problem in .NET.

My goal in life is to start a punk revolution in software development. I am also secretly [S. M. Fenton](https://www.smfenton.uk/s-m-fenton/) the author of [The Vanishing Room](https://www.smfenton.uk/the-vanishing-room/).
