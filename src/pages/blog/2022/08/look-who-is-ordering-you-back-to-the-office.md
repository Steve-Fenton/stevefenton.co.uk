This week, Malcolm Gladwell joined the ranks of people yelling at workers to *get back to work*. Like many of the people arguing for a return to office work, they tell us they don't believe it's possible to do good work unless you are under management observation.

> It’s not in your best interest to work at home. I know it’s a hassle to come into the office, but if you’re just sitting in your pyjamas in your bedroom, is that the work-life you want to live? <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

There are a number of reasons to get frustrated by this.

## Pyjamas

I work at a company who have a <a href="https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/trust">high-trust environment</a>. Our handbook tells us <a href="https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/where-you-work">"do your best work, from where you work best"</a>. I don't go to work in pyjamas. I wear a rather snazzy set of pinstripe trousers and a company tee. It's what I would wear if I went to an office. It would be fine for me to work in pyjamas if that's what helped me do my best work and live my best life... but I find that dressing for work helps me get my head into the game.

When someone accuses people who work from home of *wearing pyjamas*, it makes it look like their only work-from-home experience is from Internet memes. Or, perhaps, this is what *they* would do if they worked from home. Worse even than this explanation is that *they think they are an exception*; they wouldn't wear pyjamas, but they think "workers" would.

WFH ≠ Pyjamas

## Sense of belonging

> ...we want you to have a feeling of belonging and to feel necessary... and if you’re not here it’s really hard to do that. <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

The reality here is that a modern manager should be able to build a distributed team with a sense of purpose. It *is* really hard work to do that, which is why managers get paid to do it. If you are a manager in a modern workplace, distributed team chops are a necessary skill. If you don't have the knowledge or the techniques, go see what the old-timers of distributed teams are doing (by old-timers, we're talking about companies that did this before the pandemic).

With so many managers climbing into positions without any thought to the additional skills they need beyond "being good at the work", there are already loads of teams sitting together in the same room with no sense of purpose or belonging. This problem is not unique to distributed teams. There are specific challenges to making the magic happen in a distributed team, but it has been done.

Office ≠ Purpose

## Your best interest

You know who can discover your best interests? You. Not Malcolm Gladwell. He doesn't even know most of you. While writing the excellent book, Blink, Malcolm found what best served his interests and the interests of the project. This is how he described his process in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2005/mar/05/workandcareers.politicsphilosophyandsociety">2005</a>.

> I hate desks. Desks are now banished. I work better when I'm comfortable. <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

Yes, you read that right. Malcolm worked from home and a variety of other spots because *it's where he did his best work*. He used places like his sofa, the Savoy, the Monmouth Coffee Company. Anywhere except an office with a desk, because desks are now banished. Of course, he still had an office at The New Yorker:

> I used to go there every day and I slowly kind of weaned myself away... I felt like I was in exile when I was in the New Yorker offices. I missed being connected. <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

## Summary

I could just let Malcolm provide the closing argument for what we kinda already know to be true. Having access to an office isn't a terrible thing, but the key is to work where you can do your best work. What might be a total grind in an office, or at a desk, might become a breeze in the right location. Finding different spaces that inspire you to do awesome stuff is really the key to working remotely.

> It seems like a fun activity now. Kind of casual. It's been more seamlessly integrated into my life and that's made it much more pleasurable. I never want to be at a desk again. <cite>Malcolm Gladwell</cite>

Some people have pointed out that Malcolm relies a little on PR, which I suppose is true. Saying stuff to raise attention so people buy your excellent books is one thing... depending on the collateral damage, I suppose.

When people with shares in office space ordered us back to the office, it was really clear why they wanted us back there. Same goes for all the people whose business is adjacent to office space. You could follow the money trail in most cases.

Eventually, those businesses will adjust to a decentralised reality. Those empty local shop fronts will gain value once more as people look for those locations to place in their own rotation. A coffee shop within a ten minute walk that served great coffee could do fair business, though perhaps not as much as one giant coffee shop with the associated low levels of service. We may not want to travel to a giant office miles away, but smaller local shared spaces might be appealing when you need something like that in your rotation.

I'm not really sure what Malcolm Gladwell's motivation is for his recent statements. Maybe they were just off-the-cuff comments that we've taken a bit too seriously... it doesn't really seem like he believes any of the stuff about belonging coming from shared offices?!

Don't rush back to your office just yet, as there might be a bit more to this story.
