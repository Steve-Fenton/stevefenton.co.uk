The Windows 11 Taskbar has pretty good defaults, with all the icons pulled to the centre and the expected behaviour of managing all the windows, including groups. However, there is one particular setting that I find really useful when I’m using multiple display screens.

The taskbar is duplicated on each screen by default. This is what you might be used to, but if you use multiple displays, you are also likely to use each screen informally for a purpose. For example, I use one screen for writing and the other for research. Others use on for communication tools like email and messaging, with the other being their working surface.

There is a setting that you can enable to make the taskbar screen-specific. This means it only shows the apps that are open on the screen you're looking at. It ungroups the same app where it is open on each display and instead provides a one-click icon for the display-specific instance of the app. I know my left screen is my “research view” and my right-hand screen is my “writing view”, so I always pick the right browser icon without having to expand a group.

Here’s how you can switch it on and try it out yourself.

Right-click on the taskbar and select “Taskbar settings”.

Then look for the option under Taskbar behaviours titled “When using multiple displays, show my taskbar apps on…”. If you change this to “Taskbar where window is open” you will find you now have a taskbar per display. That means when you click on the taskbar icon, you know which of your displays the item will open on.

If you are using two instances of the same app, but on different displays, they will no longer be grouped, and you now don’t need to expand the group to choose the correct instance.

I hope you find this useful.
