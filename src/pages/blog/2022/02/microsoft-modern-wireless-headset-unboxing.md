This month I joined [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com), and one of the things everyone takes seriously is having high-quality online conversations. It makes sense that everyone should have a good experience during meetings in a remote-first company.

I have been using a Sennheiser wired headset for the past two years, but this makes it impossible to move around my office when I’m catching up on company updates or attending one of the many virtual meet-ups, like the 20 Years of .NET celebration this week. With all this in mind, I wanted a high-quality wireless headset that I could use for meetings and audio/video.

After the usual agonising research, I bought the [Modern Wireless Headset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/microsoft-modern-wireless-headset/8wn49139qkjf) from Microsoft. This purchase was made with my own money, so this isn’t a sponsored post or promotion, even though I'm a Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies.

## Neat features

I’m pretty excited to share a couple of elegant features.

The first is a feature I found on a few headsets, but perhaps not so refined. The mic flips up when you aren’t using it and when you do this, it mutes. You get a subtle but unmistakable mute tone, and a different unmute tone when you flip it back down. That’s one less keyboard shortcut to remember on calls.

It only does this when the microphone is in use, so you don’t get tones if you flip the mic up or down at other times. You can also hit a button on the headset to mute the mic, at which point the little light indicator on the mic comes into play as you can see from the corner of your eye that you are muted (if you can see your own video, you can also see it subtly glowing there too).

The second neat feature is that the right-hand headphone incorporates a large circular volume control, so you can adjust the volume with a quick turn of the dial.

When you switch on the headset, a nice announcement tells you how many hours of battery you have remaining. This means you don’t need to worry about forgetting to charge the headset or running out of juice mid-call. They pack enough power for 50 hours of music or 30 hours of calls (presumably, the microphone and beamforming noise-reduction features use extra power for calls). It takes about two to three hours to get a full charge.

## Installation

The headset supports Bluetooth and comes with a tiny USB dongle that you can just plug in for a hassle-free setup. If you use the Bluetooth option, there’s a dedicated pairing button (rather than an arcane combination of long presses).

## Audio quality

The audio quality is good for music and calls. There’s clarity throughout the tonal ranges, as tested using The Dead Love’s ‘Summer’ with everything sounding crisp and clean, with enough punch to make listening to music a joy.

On calls, the speaker comes through loud and clear, especially when it’s someone from the Octopus community team, as they all use incredible condenser microphones that make them sound like radio DJs or voice-over artists.

## Comfort

These are on-ear headphones, which is my personal preference. I find in-ear headphones uncomfortable, and big over-ear headphones squash my ears onto my glasses. A good on-ear headphone has a good fit to make the sound clear without putting too much pressure on your ears. These do the job perfectly; they are reasonably light at 136 grams, which is impressive given the solid build quality.

The padded headphones make them all-day wearable, and the headband has soft padding along the underside, so there is no plastic against your head.

## Value for money

These are mid-weight for a headset. There are many options around the £50 mark, and the premium options range from £170 to £250. At under £100, these are excellent value for money. The audio and mic quality definitely perform above that price range, and the quality of materials and construction certainly has a premium feel. There’s no spongy foam like you’d find on a budget headset here.

## Summary

This is a serious piece of kit at a competitive price. A fussy version of me would have wanted a bit of alloy to match my Surface Book and ergonomic keyboard, but they look sleek and stylish in all black.

You can get cheaper headsets, but not with the sound quality and attention to design details that this headset has.
