There are still some lessons from the fable of boiling a frog, even though it has been debunked.

I hardly dare repeat it, but the idea is that if you put a frog in *boiling* water, it will jump straight out. But if you put it in *cool* water and gradually raise the temperature, the frog won't realise the danger and will remain in the water until it’s *Rane alla Camuna* (cooked).

Now, the original fable is bunk, and so are the variations. Let’s look at an actual study and then determine what we can still learn from the fable.

> The ‘critical thermal maxima’ of many species of frogs have been determined by several investigators. In this procedure, the water in which a frog is submerged is heated gradually at about 2 degrees Fahrenheit per minute.
> 
> As the temperature of the water is gradually increased, the frog will eventually become more and more active in attempts to escape the heated water. If the container size and opening allow the frog to jump out, it will do so. <cite> [Dr. Victor Hutchison](https://archive-srel.uga.edu/outreach/ecoviews/ecoview071223.htm)</cite>

The *critical thermal maxima* is the point at which the animal becomes woozy, can’t move in an organised fashion, and is likely to die. It’s better not to imagine how you discover this temperature because it is done precisely how you’d think.

However, there *are* at least two lessons we can learn from the myth of the boiling frog.

- The power of narratives
- How little we fact-check

## Narratives

First, **people like a tidy narrative** and facts aren't enough to make them drop a good story.

It’s a similar case whether you have a good old story or if you just create a phrase that rhymes. It’s neat, so it sounds true.

> Bed at eleven, wake fresh at seven.

I just made that up, but it rings with ancient-sounding wisdom. If you hear something pithy, engage rational scepticism before your brain laps up a lie. The more convincing something sounds, the more dangerous it is.

## Fact-checking

Second, **people don’t fact-check** their tales before posting them, liking them, or sharing them. For some reason, nobody can be bothered to check if something is factual before they spread it.

This is the primary reason Theory-X management persists despite all the evidence that contradicts its fundamental premise.

## Doing better

Our businesses, communities, countries, and planet *really* need us to do better. It starts with a story about a boiling frog. It escalates with governments being permitted to lie and claim it’s "part of politics". It ends with the planet turning into a hot lifeless rock floating through space.

Next time you see a tidy story, *take care before you share* (you’re welcome for that one).

Do a bit of research before you spread potentially false information.
