Today I walked up and down a pretty long hotel corridor a few times and observed an interesting process for cleaning. Without going into details, the result of all the effort was a line of partially cleaned rooms.

## Partially clean is somewhat dirty

If you have partially cleaned twenty rooms, the number of clean rooms is zero. Each partially cleaned room is also somewhat dirty, too.

It’s the same if you partially write a book, or partially bake a cake, or write some code that will eventually solve a user’s problem (once more code is added). If you start lots of stuff, the number of completed things stays at zero for a long time. Often “a long time” is too long.

So, what if we completely cleaned some rooms.

## Finish some rooms

“Ah, but there isn’t time to fully clean them *all*,” you say, waving a feather duster for emphasis. “We’d only have five fully cleaned rooms.”

That’s five more than you have now. If you are smart when choosing which five to pick… it might even be enough.

At the start of the process, there were twenty rooms in various states.

- Some are already relatively clean, such as those that were empty overnight.
- Some are somewhat clean, such as those with guests who like to keep things clean.
- Some would not be described as clean at all.

Additionally, some rooms will have guests arriving today, while others will remain empty tonight. That’s the first cut. If no guest will be held up by delaying the room, it can be pushed back. It could be cleaned *after* check-ins open for the day without upsetting a customer. It will still be cleaned, if necessary, after the higher-priority rooms.

## Manage the situation

If there are still too many rooms to do before guests arrive, you can experiment with strategies for handling the rooms. This is the stuff people employ managers for (and the smartest managers nurture their teams, so they generate great ideas).

If you concentrate on the worst rooms, you’ll get fewer done, but if a guest arrives for one of the cleaner rooms, they won’t have to wait as long. You could try doing the quick rooms first, as you increase the probability that a room will be ready when a guest arrives (assuming pure chance, of course).

## Summary

The precise method of deciding which rooms to clean before guests arrive is less critical if you already chose *not* to clean some of them… but even a single completed room gives you a better service level than twenty partly clean rooms.

If all twenty were needed, the partial cleaning method means 100% of guests have to wait, whereas it has a lower 95% average if you fully clean one room.
