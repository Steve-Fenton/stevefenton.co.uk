This is a pretty neat feature coming to Microsoft Edge. You hit <kbd>CTRL + SHIFT + W</kbd> and it brings up a little rectangle that you can position over some content you want to copy. If you’ve ever fought with a browser when trying to select text, but missed something like the first character – this feature solves that problem.

The feature also lets you sub-select across a number of vertical containers, with only the stuff inside the rectangle making it onto your clipboard. In the below example, just the highlighted content gets ripped out onto the clipboard.

The clipboard from this screenshot has been “emptied” below so you can see the result.

This is particularly brilliant for selecting content from tables, as shown below, and then pasted into a Word document.
