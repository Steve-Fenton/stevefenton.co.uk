Everything is becoming a subscription these days. The combination of convenient smaller regular payments for customers and a recurring revenue base for the provider means this model feels like the magic formula all around. Whether it’s kitchen appliances from AO, razors from Harry’s, food from Hello Fresh, or a car from Cazoo – you can enjoy the flexibility of subscription-based services for practially anything.

However, there is one thing you really need to check *before* you hit subscribe and enter your payment card.

So, head to their FAQs, read the terms of service, and check review sites to find out how you cancel the subscription.

## Customer view of cancellation

Whether you are paying a few dollars per month or a few hundred – when you’re ready to quit it, you need to know that there is a button to press that ends the subscription. If you have to call, write, or turn up in person, think twice before you sign up.

Some territories are considering legislation to force companies to make it as easy to cancel as it is to sign up. This includes allowing cancellation to be done on the same channel as the subscription, so if you sign-up online, they must let you cancel online, too. Until this is made a legal requirement, you must check it yourself.

Make sure the provider gives you a simple push-button cancellation process that you can complete quickly for yourself.

Don’t trust marketing promises for this. Advertising saying you can “cancel anytime” might sound like they are aligned with simple off-boarding, but some companies are putting roadblocks and traps in the way of a graceful exit. Don’t just check you can cancel; make sure it's *self-service* and *push-button*. They probably don't offer it if they don’t say they do in their FAQs.

Double-check the terms of service to ensure it’s part of the deal and that there are no surprising notice periods, minimum contract lengths, or termination charges.

## The business view of cancellation

In a [video post by Patrick Campbell of ProfitWell](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1504469263725125643), he reminded companies that 40% of cancellations are due to factors outside your control. If you make the off-boarding process painful, you are wrecking future reactivation rates.

To understand this, consider these three modes of off-boarding:

1. Self-service cancel button. You click. You’re done.
2. Q&A-driven self-service cancellation process. You answer a couple of questions and possibly get a special offer to stay, but otherwise are done.
3. Call to cancel. You call, listen to robots, push buttons, wait for a human, and then get a sales pitch.

A business that allows self-service cancellations can see around 30% of customers re-activate later when their circumstances change. If your business forces customers down the call-to-cancel route, your reactivation rate is less than 10%. You made life difficult, and the customer doesn’t want to do business with you again.

## Summary

It should be as easy for a customer to end a subscription as it was to start it. This principle might even become law in some places in the future.

Even though it isn’t yet a legal requirement, it makes sense to implement it because it makes it more likely customers will return later.
