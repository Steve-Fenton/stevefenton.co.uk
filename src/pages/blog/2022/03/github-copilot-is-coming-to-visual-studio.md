Although you have to [join a waitlist](https://copilot.github.com/), there is a technical preview of GitHub Copilot integrated as a [Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilotvs).

Copilot is an AI pair programming tool that suggests code based on a colossal training set of open-source code. It can suggest line completions and entire functions as you type, and it seems to be able to contribute about 40% of your code, which will speed you up.

You can also navigate the suggestions using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>\]</kbd> for the following suggestion, or <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>\[</kbd> for the previous one â€“ so you can see what other ideas your robot helper has.
