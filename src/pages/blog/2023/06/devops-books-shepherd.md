If you know me, you know I love books. I have a [reading list](https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/about-me/recommended-reading/) on my site to remind me of important books I've read and I help maintain a substantial [interactive DevOps reading list](https://octopus.com/devops/reading-list/) containing all the books I've read that are worth sharing in the DevOps field.

I sit in the shadow of two book cases filled with books and a whole cubby is dedicated to my <abbr title="to be read">TBR</abbr> pile.

Trust me. I love books.

## Shepherd

Ben Fox is an avid reader and entrepreneur. He created [Shepherd](https://shepherd.com) to reproduce that feeling you get when you walk through a book store looking for your next read. I often get that itch of wanting to find something new to read, where I don't know what book I want - I just want to discover it. That's the idea here.

As part of this, I was invited to write a book list. This brought to mind those cards you see in your local bookstore where someone tells you why they loved a book; a personal recommendation.

## DevOps books that pre-date DevOps

My idea for the book list was to create a list of DevOps books, but from before DevOps was even a concept. Old books that are immensely valuable to modern software delivery.

You can read [my top 5 DevOps books from before DevOps was invented here](https://shepherd.com/best-books/devops-from-before-devops-was-invented).

There are lists in the same wheelhouse [from other writers here](https://shepherd.com/bookshelf/project-management).

## Books!

Reading books is like adding years of experience to your career. You get to absorb situations you weren't directly involved with and learn from folks who you might never meet.
