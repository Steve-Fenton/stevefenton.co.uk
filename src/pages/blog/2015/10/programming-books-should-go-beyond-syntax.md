[![Pro TypeScript](/img/2015/07/pro-typescript.jpg)](/publications/pro-typescript/)When I was invited to write [Pro TypeScript](/publications/pro-typescript/) for Apress, the pitch I prepared with my ace Editor, Gwenan, included a unique selling point. That USP was to go beyond the normal syntactical lessons of how to write various expressions using the programming language and talk in reasonable detail about how to apply some design to the code.

This idea had been in my mind since I first learned to use JavaScript back in the last century. The books I read were excellent at teaching the code – but not a single one supplied any advice on how to make my code easier to maintain. As a result, my first program was hideous. If only these books provided patterns and practices appropriate to the language as well as some syntax.

So my unique selling point was to include a chapter on Object Orientation in TypeScript, including practical applications of the [SOLID principles](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod) and some examples of [design patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented/dp/0201633612).

The biggest compliment I have received for this effort is that every subsequent book (to date) on TypeScript has included a chapter titled “Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript” – and most have sections covering Robert Martin’s SOLID principles; which means the TypeScript community is well set-up to create maintainable applications.

Long may this pairing of “code + code design” in programming books continue, because the syntax is far less than half of the story.
