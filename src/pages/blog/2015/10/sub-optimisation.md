![Why Do We Only ... This Bit](https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/why-do-we-dot-dot-dot.jpg)

I have a notepad filled with post-its, drawings, and hand-written notes that I use to trigger my thought process in relation to software development and this is a picture from the page that gives me the most value each time I revisit it.

The blank space allows you to add your own verb, such as “estimate”, “measure”, “rush”, “optimise”, and so on.

Even though I have flicked through my notebook many times and landed on this page, it always reminds me that we spend too much time holding a magnifying glass to the part of the value chain that technical people handle – and too little time climbing up to see the whole process.

At some point, someone will ask “how can we code faster” – and this is the kind of image you can use to explain that speed comes from optimising the whole, not just one part.
