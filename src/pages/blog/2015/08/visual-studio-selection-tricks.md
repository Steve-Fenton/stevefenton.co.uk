I find myself in the midst of one of those rote programming jobs that feels very tedious. Despite this, I am harnessing the opportunity of busy hands, idle mind to find a few handy tricks to speed things up.

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + Click selects “whole words” in Visual Studio. You can drag with this short-cut to collect a series of “whole words” too.

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> upper-cases an entire word.

The trusty old <kbd>ALT</kbd> and mouse-drag selects the same characters on multiple rows.

You may also be interested in the [widen-selection and narrow-selection short-cuts](/2013/09/visual-studio-refactoring-shortcuts/) that Robert Martin introduced me to.
