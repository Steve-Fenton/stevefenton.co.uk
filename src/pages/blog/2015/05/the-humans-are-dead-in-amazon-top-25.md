My collection of thoughts on software test automation, [The Humans are Dead](https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/publications/the-humans-are-dead/), is currently in the Top 25 in Amazon.com’s “Programming” category.

To celebrate, you can download the Kindle edition for free – but be quick, because this offer is only open for a couple of days.

You can get your free copy from any Amazon website – including:

- [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Humans-are-Dead-Software-Automation-ebook/dp/B00WDKOAUQ/)

and

- [Amazon USA](http://www.amazon.com/Humans-are-Dead-Software-Automation-ebook/dp/B00WDKOAUQ/)
