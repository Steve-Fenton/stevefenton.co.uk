If you want to get your TypeSpec test output in TAP (Test Anything Protocol) format, there is a built-in test reporter that will do this for you.

Just pass in the TapReporter to the auto runner:

```
<pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">import {AutoRunner, TapReporter} from './Scripts/TypeSpec/TypeSpec';

AutoRunner.testReporter = new TapReporter();
```
Youâ€™ll now get TAP compliant output that can easily be read by your build system.
