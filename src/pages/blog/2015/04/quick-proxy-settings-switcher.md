I switch my browser proxy settings all the time. I’m always capturing traffic in JMeter or intercepting using Burp Suite or using some other tool that requires an adjustment, so I’m in my browser settings tweaking it back and forward constantly.

[Proxy Selector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/proxy-selector/) allows you to store a number of different proxy configurations and switch between them from your context menu.

Quick tips – enable “Show in context menu” in the preferences window, which can be found by going to:

Tools &gt; Proxy Selector &gt; Manage Proxies

This is also where you’ll add your settings for the JMeter proxy, the Burp Suite proxy and so on.
