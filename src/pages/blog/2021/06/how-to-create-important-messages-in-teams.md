Sometimes you have something super-important to communicate in Microsoft Teams, so you need to be able to send an important message. But how do you create an important message in Teams?

All you need to do is use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> in the compose textarea. This will elevate your message to an important one.

When you send the message, it gets the border style and an additional icon to make sure people know you have something important to say.
