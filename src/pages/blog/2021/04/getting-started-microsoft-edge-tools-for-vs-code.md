There’s a really neat extension for <abbr title="Visual Studio">VS</abbr> Code that allows you to run Microsoft Edge browser tools. You can use this in conjunction with your own project, or even as stand-alone. It uses browser automation behind the scenes, so it does depend on you having Microsoft Edge installed on your machine.

You can add the extension by searching “Microsoft Edge Tools for VS Code” is the extensions marketplace.

You can start a session using the Edge-like icon on the left-hand toolbar. Use the “+” icon to “open a new tab” and start browsing. There’s a little preview window within VS Code, but you can opt whether to do your browsing in a full browser window (or not) by adjusting the headless browsing setting.
