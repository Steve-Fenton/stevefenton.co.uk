I haven’t mentioned pie charts for a while, but Lloyds Bank have plastered this advert everywhere with their CD-shaped pie chart (also known as Leggera Charts). It is worth pointing out how rubbish it is.

Even if it wasn’t [a true fact that pie charts are never the right chart to display your data](/blog/2009/04/pie-charts-are-bad/), they haven’t even followed [the rules that make pie charts readable](/blog/2011/10/a-great-example-of-a-terrible-pie-chart/).

So they didn’t order the data from highest to lowest. They didn’t give any indication of values, they rely solely on colour to match the the labels to the segments and, let’s face it, this should just be a column chart.

Footnote: The term “Leggara Chart” was originally coined by pro Agilista, Dan Phipps.
