Cranked helps teams and organisations to effectively deliver software in a changeable or uncertain environment. This book will teach you all about the values, activities and practices that you need to know to delight your customers with your software product. With the techniques in this book you can:

- Improve product quality
- Release faster and with fewer errors
- Focus on value
- Deliver more features
- Increase motivation and job satisfaction
- Make your customers and end-users happy

If you are already working in an agile or lean team, Cranked could accelerate you to the next level. If you are switching to agile or lean – Cranked will help you to avoid common problems in failed agile adoptions. Cranked can be used in any size of organisation to solve complex software development problems.

> A great introduction to the method that worked for this team. It’s refreshing to have a book about a software method that doesn’t feel like it’s got an ulterior motive than just to share best practices. Looking forward to sharing this with my team and seeing whether they would work for us. – Wyndham Hudson
