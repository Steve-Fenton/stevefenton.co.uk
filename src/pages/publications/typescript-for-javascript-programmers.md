This was the first book ever published on the TypeScript programming language. If you want to learn TypeScript, my up-to-date book is [Pro TypeScript (Second Edition)](/publications/pro-typescript/).

> This book is the perfect introduction, covering classes, interfaces, enumerations, generics and more. I found it very a useful way to learn the language and easily followed the clear and concise code examples. Thoroughly recommended.

> This book is a great read. Like this review, it is short, to the point, and explains the key concepts clearly \[…\] Even if I do not end up using TypeScript, it has already taught me a few things I didn’t know about JavaScript.

> This book takes you through each skill that you need to learn TypeScript step by step, so you can follow along and observe TypeScript in action. This is a short book, easy to read and follow, and you will know 99% of Typescript when you finish it.

> As a C# developer who’s a little scared of Javascript, Typescript is now my preferred method of writing JavaScript. This book is the perfect introduction, covering classes, interfaces, enumerations, generics and more. I found it very a useful way to learn the language and easily followed the clear and concise code examples. Thoroughly recommended.
