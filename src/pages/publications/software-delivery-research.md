We have solidly moved into the era of research-backed software delivery. Over the past ten years, we've learned a great deal about what works and what doesn't. We no longer depend solely on *strong voices* as we now have *solid data*.

My favourite research efforts are:

- The [Accelerate State of DevOps Report](https://dora.dev/research/) from [DORA](https://dora.dev/)
- The [State of CI/CD Report](https://cd.foundation/reports/) from the [CD Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) and [SlashData](https://www.slashdata.co/)

But also, I'm a naturally curious person. That means I ask questions to find out more about how we're all delivering software. For this reason, I'll be running some research to find out more about how we're all working.

## State of GitOps

At Octopus, we ran an industry survey to find out more about GitOps. Based on 660 responses to our survey, we're investigating:

- What good GitOps looks like
- Current industry adoption of GitOps
- Future plans for GitOps
- The relationship between GitOps and DevOps
- The benefits of GitOps
- Which GitOps practices drive outcomes

The report is likely to come out in June 2025. Sign up to get a free copy of [the state of GitOps report](https://octopus.com/publications/state-of-gitops-report). 

## Platform Engineering

I'm working with Saim Safdar, host of [the Cloud Native Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@cloudnativefm) to find out the business and technical motivations for Platform Engineering.

Our plan is to:

- (Done!) Speak to practitioners to find out key motivations for internal developer platforms
- (Done!) Design a survey based on what we learn
- (Done!) Run the survey to get a broad picture of Platform Engineering

By collaborating on this project, we hope create an independent research effort and I'm sure our findings will make it into our writing, podcasts, and webinars.

We have our first batch of survey responses and we'll be analyzing them and sharing results soon!

## Get updates

I've created a [research-only mailing list](https://oc.to/research-updates) for folks who want to stay updated.
