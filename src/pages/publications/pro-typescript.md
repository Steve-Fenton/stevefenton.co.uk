## What’s New in The Second Edition

You know how busy the TypeScript team and wider community have been making TypeScript awesome – there are many changes. I have fully updated the book with all the changes and completely re-written a couple of the chapters (hey, Node/Express changed things too!)

- Coverage of major changes to modules, namespaces, and module loading
- New guidance on how to use inference to reduce the effort of using TypeScript
- Recommendations on compiler options
- A wide range of feature updates from intersections and tuples to async/await and the new approach to mixins

The first edition was published in 2014 under ISBN 978-1-4302-6790-4 for the ebook and ISBN 978-1-4302-6791-1 for the softcover.

The second edition can be found under ISBN 978-1-4842-3249-1 for the ebook and ISBN 978-1-4842-3248-4 for the softcover. Please ensure you get the second edition as a lot changed in three years because the language was so new when the first edition published. Things are more stable now.

## Praise for the First Edition

> This is perhaps one of the best books for beginners and experts alike. If you’re brand new to TypeScript you will learn everything you need by reading Pro TypeScript. The author Steve Fenton does an excellent job of explaining the fundamentals and how TS compiles down into JavaScript.

> But Steve also explains specific design patterns and best practices for writing quality TypeScript code. Each chapter builds upon the last and you never feel like you’re left out to dry on your own. – [What Pixel](http://whatpixel.com/top-10-typescript-books/)

The writer is very clear, very articulate and thorough (nothing left out) without making you feel like you are soaking up stuff you can’t use. – (Amazon Customer)
