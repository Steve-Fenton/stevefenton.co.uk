## What’s New in The Second Edition

You know how busy the TypeScript team and wider community have been making TypeScript awesome – there’s a lot of changes. I have fully updated the book with all of the changes, and completely re-written a couple of the chapters (hey, Node/Express went and changed things too!)

- Coverage of major changes to modules, namespaces, and module loading
- New guidance on how to use inference to reduce the effort of using TypeScript
- Recommendations on compiler options
- A wide range of feature updates from intersections and tuples to async/await and the new approach to mixins

The first edition was published in 2014 under ISBN 978-1-4302-6790-4 for the ebook and ISBN 978-1-4302-6791-1 for the softcover.

The second edition can be found under ISBN 978-1-4842-3249-1 for the ebook and ISBN 978-1-4842-3248-4 for the softcover. Please make sure you are getting the second edition as a lot changed in three years.

## Praise for the First Edition

The writer is very clear, very articulate and thorough (nothing left out) without making you feel like you are soaking up stuff you can’t use. – (Amazon Customer)
