This was the first book ever published on the TypeScript programming language. If you want to learn TypeScript, my up-to-date book is [Pro TypeScript (Second Edition)](/publications/pro-typescript/).

> This book is the perfect introduction, covering classes, interfaces, enumerations, generics and more. I found it very a useful way to learn the language and easily followed the clear and concise code examples. Thoroughly recommended.

> This book is a great read. Like this review, it is short, to the point, and explains the key concepts clearly \[…\] Even if I do not end up using TypeScript, it has already taught me a few things I didn’t know about JavaScript.

> This book takes you through each skill that you need to learn TypeScript step by step, so you can follow along and observe TypeScript in action. This is a short book, easy to read and follow, and you will know 99% of Typescript when you finish it.

> As a C# developer who’s a little scared of Javascript, Typescript is now my preferred method of writing JavaScript. This book is the perfect introduction, covering classes, interfaces, enumerations, generics and more. I found it very a useful way to learn the language and easily followed the clear and concise code examples. Thoroughly recommended.

## TypeScript Succinctly

> …it’s free, well written, does not waffle on (unlike myself) and gets you started with TypeScript fast <cite>[Ryan O’Neill](http://ryanoneill.com/typescript-succintly/)</cite>

And…

> The book doesn’t pretend to make you a TypeScript guru but its a great introduction if you want seriously mastering it. <cite>Corrado</cite>

## The Reason Your Website Sucks

> I wouldn’t put myself in the category of web developer or designer I just run a couple of websites for myself and other people. I found this book very informative and easy to read, there is no technical jargon, just explanations of common problems and how to solve them. It mostly highlighted (apparently common) mistakes I’d made with my websites and allowed me to correct them. I’d recommend this book to anyone who owns a website, it doesn’t take too long to read so there really are no excuses. <cite>[Online Review (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R18KRLCLB771DJ/)</cite>

The Reason Your Website Sucks – Practical advice for website owners, has been published as a paperback and also as a digital download. Contains exclusive illustrations by artist Gill Gregory as well as a ton of useful information for website owners.
