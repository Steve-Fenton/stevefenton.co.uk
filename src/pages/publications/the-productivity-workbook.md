## Book overview

The Productivity Workbook contains templated daily planner sheets to track The Pomodoro Technique each day for three months, with space to track tasks and sessions. There are handy prompts to remind you how to run your sessions and take breaks.

By combining Getting Things Done, Personal Kanban, and The Pomodoro Technique, you can have a complete solution to organising all your ideas and options from project-size big stuff all the way down to your next actionable task.

The introduction contains a refresher to help you combine the three productivity techniques and a short guide to using the workbook.

## Free downloads

In a break from tradition, I have made the book available under the [Creative Commons Non-Commercial, No-Derivatives License (CC BY-NC-ND)](https://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Files are available to download below if you want to print your own worksheets or full books with the introduction, notes pages, and organisation into weeks. It’s best to print on good quality stock as you’ll write on them. The cover isn’t available to download here, as the license for the excellent cover art is limited-run, so I can’t distribute it – feel free to get creative with your own covers!
