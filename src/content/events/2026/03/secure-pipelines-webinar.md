With Gwen Burchell, Cristian Garcia, and Steve Fenton.

Most software pipelines focus on writing code and deploying it, but the real risk is what happens in between. Join Cloudsmith and Octopus Deploy to learn how to build trust in software artifacts and enforce security and compliance through your Golden Path.

Things you'll learn

- Why “what we built is what we deployed” is a board-level concern
- Where the biggest trust gaps exist in modern SDLCs
- What artifact and delivery trust really mean
- How to design Golden Paths that enforce trust, not just convenience
- What a real chain of custody looks like in Kubernetes platforms
