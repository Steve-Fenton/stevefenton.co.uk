The Cloud Native Computing Foundation's flagship conference brings together adopters and technologists from leading open source and cloud native communities.

Find me at ArgoCon, Platform Engineering day, and Platform Coffee sessions as well as the Octopus booth for conversations on GitOps, Platform Engineering research, metrics, and deployment automation.

I'll also be doing a short talk at the Cloudsmith booth on March 25, 2026 at 12 noon.
