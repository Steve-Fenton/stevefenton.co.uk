Feel free to stop me for a chat about DevOps, Continuous Delivery, metrics, and deployment automation if you spot me walking around the conference floor.

## Talk synopsis

I spent years taking on development teams and transforming them into high performers and the team members were never the problem. This session leans on years of "transformations" and a decade of research to provide some concrete steps you can take to do the same.

The DORA research reveals what elite performers do differently, but knowing what to improve and actually making improvements are different challenges. This session cuts through the complexity to focus on the handful of high-impact capabilities you can start using today.

You'll learn:

- Where to start for the biggest returns
- How to sequence your efforts
- How to build momentum toward elite performance levels without trying to transform everything at once
