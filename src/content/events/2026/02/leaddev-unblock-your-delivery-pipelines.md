With Francine Pilot, Steve Fenton, Simone Casciaroli, and Ryn Daniels.

13:00 Greenwich Mean Time.

Even the most well-intentioned delivery pipeline can lead to unintended workarounds. You may have selected best-in-class tooling and defined best practices, but no two teams or projects are the same. When delivery pressure builds, teams find inventive ways to bypass systems that aren’t serving them, leading to increased rework and risk.

For engineering managers and platform engineers, the challenge is to identify where teams need more options and find ways to provide them without abandoning the appropriate constraints.

In this panel discussion, we’re lifting the lid on why and where the most common workarounds crop up in delivery pipelines, and the modern aspects of software delivery that enable you to stop them in their tracks.

Key takeaways:

- The most common delivery workarounds and why they happen
- Rooting out unnecessary sources of developer friction
- Allowing more choice in tool selection while maintaining robust delivery practices
